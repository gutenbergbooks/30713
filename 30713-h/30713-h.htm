<h1>CAPTAIN POTT&rsquo;S MINISTER</h1>
<div class='chsp'>
<a name='CHAPTER_I' id='CHAPTER_I'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
</div>
<p>The sound of voices suddenly arrested
Captain Pott&rsquo;s fork in mid-air, and the morsel
of untasted salt-mackerel dangled uncertainly
from the points of the dingy tines as
he swung about to face the open door. Fork
and mackerel fell to the floor as the seaman
abruptly rose and stalked outside. The stern
features of the rugged old face sagged with
astonishment as he blinked at the small army
of men swarming over his littered yard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Mornin&rsquo;, Cap&rsquo;n,&rdquo; cheerily called Hank
Simpson, the village storekeeper, as he approached
the irate man on the stoop.</p>
<p>Captain Pott was so completely jarred out
of his usual complacency that for once he had
nothing to say. He forgot even to swear.
As the significance of the movements of the
intruders suddenly dawned upon him he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
mutely glared at Hank from beneath blackened
and swollen eyelids.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The women-folks said that you&rsquo;d be
wantin&rsquo; to make your place look peart, bein&rsquo;
as the new minister is goin&rsquo; to stay here with
you,&rdquo; explained Hank, who was apparently
the leader of the group. &ldquo;When we men-folks
heard that they was goin&rsquo; to clean up on
the inside we thought it wouldn&rsquo;t be no more
than neighborly for us to pitch in and give you
a hand with the outside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was evident that the Captain did not
relish the explanation, for he bristled with
dangerous hostility as he took a step forward.
But before he could refer Hank Simpson and
his entire male army to a certain warm climate
where he thought they might go with mutual
advantage to himself and them, the morning
breeze carried within earshot another note,
higher in the scale, but unmistakable in significance.
Silently the old man stood and
dumbly watched a procession of petticoats
march up to his gate and turn into the cinder
path.</p>
<p>The female army took possession of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
house even as the men had taken possession of
the yard, and he who had commanded mutinous
crews on the briny deep fled and took
refuge in the shade of a spreading elm near
the well. Mrs. Eadie Beaver, the Captain&rsquo;s
next-door neighbor, approached him, requested
that he pitch in and help, and then as
quickly beat a retreat before the fierce glare.
Hank Simpson once asked where they might
burn the accumulated trash. The answer was
unsatisfactory though forceful. Hank declared,
&ldquo;Them instructions is wuth a heap,
Cap&rsquo;n, but unless you&rsquo;ve got a trap-door to
them parts hereabout, I reckon we&rsquo;ll have to
do the crematin&rsquo; some other way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All the shutters on the old house were
thrown wide open, and sunshine and air were
allowed to penetrate corners where dust and
cobwebs had held undisputed sway for years.
Through the open windows came the sound of
tack-hammer and puller, the moving of tables,
sideboards, and chairs, and of every other article
of furniture that was not actually built
into the walls. From his place beneath the
elm the Captain heard all these sounds, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
watched his old pieces being piled in a confused
mass about the front yard. He was
smoking incessantly, and swearing no less frequently.</p>
<p>From up the road came the sharp thud of
beating hoofs. As horse and rider came into
view he deliberately turned in the opposite
direction. At the gate the rider drew rein
and swung lithely to the ground. Many
young admirers gathered quickly about the
hitching-post, but the girl was too swift for
them. With a friendly nod and smile she
tossed her reins to a bashful youngster, and
tripped up the path to where the seaman was
standing.</p>
<p>The daughter of the senior Elder of the
Little River church had always been fond of
Captain Pott. When but an infant she had
looked up into the clear blue eyes, adoration
and love in her own. During childhood she
had sat contentedly on his knee, or on a stool
at his feet, listening with rapt interest to his
stories of adventure by land and sea. The
Captain had never been able to spin the wild
yarns commonly known to be his habit when
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
Elizabeth Fox was his only audience. This
was not due to any fear that she would have
detected fraud in his impossible tales, but to
the fact that he could not lie when the gaze of
her big blue eyes was fastened on him.</p>
<p>To-day she edged near and waited for recognition.
Locks of her fair hair, shaken loose
by her ride, went straying bewitchingly over
her face and forehead. The smile in her eyes
crept down to the corners of her mouth as she
sought the averted face above her. But all
she could glimpse were violent motions of one
ragged point of his moustache as it kept imperfect
time with the unseen end which was
being viciously chewed.</p>
<p>At length, the irresistible little attraction at
his side proved too strong for the Captain&rsquo;s
stubbornness, and he looked down into her big
blue eyes. At sight of his own blackened and
swollen lids Elizabeth uttered a sharp cry.
She took the roughened hand in hers and gave
it a gentle squeeze. But her deep concern was
quickly followed by a ripple of laughter.
Hers was a laugh that was as good to see as to
hear. The Captain smiled a wholly unintentional
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
smile and returned the pressure of her
hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me, Uncle Josiah!&rdquo; she exclaimed.
&ldquo;You look so like a terrible old storm-cloud!
And those awful eyes! Where on earth did
you get them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cal&rsquo;late I feel a heap sight worse than I
look, Beth. That set of females&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But your black eyes!&rdquo; she interrupted.
&ldquo;Who made them like that? Has some one
been fighting you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A feller handed &rsquo;em out to me last night,
and I didn&rsquo;t happen to be in a position to refuse
&rsquo;em,&rdquo; he replied, his grisly weather-browned
features lighting up with a wry smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who dared strike you like that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, don&rsquo;t you worry, Beth. It ain&rsquo;t as
bad as it looks. You see, I was on my way
over from the station last night from the late
city train. When I got to the top of the hill
I sot down for a spell, and while I was thinking,
I looked down on my place. I see a light
in the pantry window flicker up, die down, and
then settle into a steady glow. I cal&rsquo;lated it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
must be pirates aboard the old craft, so I tore
down the hill like blazes and busted into the
house. Something struck me like a ton of
brick, and I went down. I never see so many
stars in all my life. The next thing I heard
was a voice asking if I was hurt, and saying,
&lsquo;You&rsquo;ll pardon me, sir.&rsquo;&rdquo; He chuckled with
his first sign of mirth. &ldquo;When I got my
senses back there was a big feller sitting on
me, nearly choking off my wind. He brung
out one of them lightning-bug flashlights and
turned it full on me, and then shouted like a
maniac, &lsquo;Why, it&rsquo;s Cap&rsquo;n Pott!&rsquo; &lsquo;That&rsquo;s
me, but who in hell be you?&rsquo; I&rsquo;m telling you
just as I said it. He told me his name was
Mack McGowan. Well, I was real glad to
see him till he told me he was the new preacher
and was going to live with me. Eadie Beaver
had put him up in my house a week ago. I
was mad as hops when he told me that, and I
was going to throw him out, but,&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;again he
chuckled,&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;well, I didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You thought caution was the better part
of valor, is that it?&rdquo; questioned Elizabeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something like that, Beth. I cal&rsquo;late
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
we&rsquo;d best say nothing to a soul about this.
There&rsquo;d be some who wouldn&rsquo;t understand the
details of the transaction. It was sort of confidential,
as you might say, and there&rsquo;d be
them who&rsquo;d blame Mr. McGowan for what he
wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t exactly responsible for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Can&rsquo;t I tell it? It&rsquo;s really too good
to keep. And then,&rdquo; she added seriously,
&ldquo;people might think you have been really
fighting. Don&rsquo;t you think it would be best
to tell what actually happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mighty little any of them would care how
I got my shine. But I cal&rsquo;late it would be
best for the parson if we&rsquo;d keep it quiet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, Uncle Josiah. He is really
going to live with you, isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t that look like it?&rdquo; he asked, pointing
his pipe-stem toward the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that is for you, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For me? You&rsquo;d see that set of females
getting down on their prayer-bones for an old
sinner like me, except to ask God A&rsquo;mighty to
strike me dead. I ain&rsquo;t that popular, not
yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain Pott, I don&rsquo;t like that one bit! I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
canceled all my engagements in the city when
Father told me the other day what the ladies
of the church were planning to do for you. I
did it just to help you, and now&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, there, Beth.&rdquo; The old man
reached out and touched her arm. &ldquo;Excuse
me, Beth. I feel like a cantankerous old sore-headed
bear this morning. Of course, you
come home to help me. I didn&rsquo;t mean to hurt
your feelings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They mean well, too,&rdquo; she loyally defended
her neighbors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was awful nice of you,&rdquo; he replied, ignoring
her reference to those at work in the
house. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s worth it to put up with that
whole pack inside just to have you come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, now, I have my good old Uncle
back again.&rdquo; She had always called him
Uncle. &ldquo;But tell me, why do you feel so
badly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About them in there?&rdquo; He jerked his
thumb toward the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No-o. I think I can understand your
feelings about them. I feel the same way
sometimes. If I were the minister it would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
take all of my religion during the week so I&rsquo;d
have nothing to preach on Sunday. But,
there! Father must never hear of my saying
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He ain&rsquo;t likely to hear it from me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you quarreled with Father again?&rdquo;
She stared apprehensively.</p>
<p>Denial sprang to the Captain&rsquo;s lips, but
when he looked into her eyes and saw there the
expression of eagerness, he turned away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have!&rdquo; she averred. &ldquo;I thought so!
And after Father was so kind as to let you
have the money to repair and paint your
house!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beth, we ain&rsquo;t exactly quarreled. Leastwise,
he ain&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he finished lamely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle Josiah, why will you and Father
never understand each other? Father is so
kind and good, and so are you, and yet you
are never able to agree. Why is it?&rdquo; she implored.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too much alike, I cal&rsquo;late. But honest,
Beth, I ain&rsquo;t got nothing particular against
your father, and if I had I&rsquo;d sink my feelings
to Davy&rsquo;s locker for your sake. The trouble
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
is, I&rsquo;ve been expecting too much, and I ain&rsquo;t
got any right to ask your father to put himself
out for an old hulk like me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What sheer nonsense! I&rsquo;ve half a mind
to scold you. Of course, Father is willing to
put himself out for you. Only this morning
he said he would do all in his power to get a
ship for you to command.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s said something like that to me, too,
several times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he&rsquo;ll do it, if you will only be patient.
Father always keeps his word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t seen the new parson yet, have
you?&rdquo; asked the seaman, anxious to change a
dangerous subject.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How could I, when I&rsquo;ve just reached
home? Father tells me he is a real Prince
Charming,&rdquo; she finished, with a wicked little
laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he, really, Uncle Josiah?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He ain&rsquo;t so bad on looks, if that&rsquo;s what
you&rsquo;re driving at.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father says he must be very strong, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cal&rsquo;late he ain&rsquo;t lacking on that p&rsquo;int,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
neither,&rdquo; agreed the Captain, blinking his
swollen eyelids.</p>
<p>Elizabeth laughed heartily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! By the way, what did you and your
handsome minister do to Father last night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is your pa ailing, too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He says he is quite lame, and when I
asked him what the matter was, he only smiled,
and told me to find out from you. Did your
minister take him for a burglar, too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that all your father said about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, except that it was his own fault.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Pott chuckled. &ldquo;I feared he
wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t going to see it that way last night.
Eadie Beaver put the parson in here while I
was in the city on a special trip. She came
over the day I left last week, and said it would
be real nice if he could live with me and eat
with her. I told her I&rsquo;d see about shipping a
parson in my house, meaning I&rsquo;d have nothing
to do with him. Well, she went ahead and
bunked him here, thinking I&rsquo;d meant it was all
right. It &rsquo;pears she done it against your father&rsquo;s
ideas, too. So he come over last night
and tried to get Mr. McGowan to move out.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
That made me madder than what Eadie had
done, so I asked him right then if he was willing
to stay. He said he was. Your pa got
sore, and started real dignified to go home.
The candle that Mr. McGowan had been using
was on the floor, and your pa&rsquo;s heel hit it.
His cane went up and he went down. His
high hat took a swim in a bucket of soapy
water that the parson had been using to swab
decks with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father is so very dignified! It must have
been quite funny,&rdquo; she commented, between
paroxysms of laughter. &ldquo;I wish I could
have seen him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twas a mite funny. I fished his beaver
out the pail, and he made off holding it away
from him like it was p&rsquo;ison.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sudden seriousness on the part of the girl
caused the Captain to look in the direction of
her gaze. A tall young man had emerged
from the back door of the house, pail in hand.
He came hurriedly toward the well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s him,&rdquo; confirmed the seaman in answer
to a look from Elizabeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He? A minister?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;You see now why I wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t strong enough
to throw him out, don&rsquo;t you? I cal&rsquo;late Eadie
Beaver would say the Lord took my strength
away, but the Lord don&rsquo;t need to give that
feller a hand. He&rsquo;s a hull host to himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t look in the least like one,&rdquo; declared
Elizabeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t? Why, his arm is as big&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no! I mean he doesn&rsquo;t look like a
minister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He ain&rsquo;t like none I ever see. He used to
ship with me during the summer months when
he was in school, and he&rsquo;s man clean to the
ground. I can&rsquo;t see why in tarnation a big
feller like him wants to take up such a sissy&rsquo;s
job of piloting a lot of women to heaven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it isn&rsquo;t that kind of work, unless one
makes it such,&rdquo; she defended.</p>
<p>Mr. McGowan came to a halt on the opposite
edge of the well-curbing. It was very
unladylike, and Elizabeth knew it, but in
spite of herself she continued to stare.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me interduce you,&rdquo; suggested the
Captain.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, I&rsquo;d better run along and help
those in the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But she failed to suit the action to the word,
and for the simple reason that the gaze of two
perfectly normal young people became normally
entangled. At length, a flood of color
crept slowly into the girl&rsquo;s cheeks, and she
smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;I beg your pardon for&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; began
the minister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, young feller,&rdquo; cut in the Captain
as Mr. McGowan turned away, &ldquo;I want to
interduce you to my best friend, Miss Elizabeth
Fox. This here is the new minister,
Beth, Mack McGowan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elizabeth cordially extended her hand.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been hearing very interesting stories
about your prowess, Mr. McGowan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I trust they are true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, they are. Captain Pott told me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did make quite an impression on him,&rdquo;
replied Mr. McGowan as he looked at the seaman&rsquo;s
swollen eyelids. &ldquo;I fear you&rsquo;ve heard
prejudiced accounts of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like them that way one bit,&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
laughed Elizabeth, &ldquo;even if a clergyman did
do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here! I ain&rsquo;t going to stand this insinuating
any longer,&rdquo; interposed the Captain,
his good humor fully restored. &ldquo;I cal&rsquo;late
they might want a hand to help swab
decks, so I&rsquo;ll be going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Uncle Josiah,&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, Beth. I&rsquo;ve been unpleasant, but
being as you have come from the city to help
me clean up the old craft, I&rsquo;d otter show my
appreciation by bossing the crew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He seized the pail from the not unwilling
minister, filled it from the well-bucket, and
went to the kitchen to report for duty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think you&rsquo;ll like Little River well
enough to wish to remain?&rdquo; asked Elizabeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I think I shall. Mr. Simpson has
been telling me about your brother, and about
his far-sightedness in organizing the Athletic
Club.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did Mr. Simpson tell you how the club
came to be formed in the first place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but I think it a splendid idea. I
hope the boys will let me be one of them.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span></div>
<p>She eyed him curiously. &ldquo;Father sees no
good in the organization. I do. Most of the
boys are Harold&rsquo;s friends,&ndash;&ndash;Harold is my
brother,&ndash;&ndash;but there are some who are not
friendly to any one except the Innkeeper. I
think you ought to know that the decent ones
were one time in the Sunday school, but because
some of your <a name='TC_1'></a><ins class="tnchg" title=" &#34;spelling standardized&#34;">church members</ins> would not
try to understand them, they were forced to
go to the Inn to set up their gymnasium.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t the Inn as good a place as any?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I prefer not to say. You&rsquo;ll doubtless
find that out for yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is one thing I intend to find out.
I&rsquo;ve an invitation to visit the rooms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, so soon? And do you really
mean to go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly. Why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose there is no reason why you
should not. But&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; she paused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard that sort of statement several
times to-day, and invariably with the little
&lsquo;but&rsquo; at the end. I&rsquo;m curious to know why
my presence at the Inn will cause any disturbance.
Is that the inference?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Other ministers have tried to get hold of
the boys, but they went at it wrong, and
failed,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try to go at the matter from the right
end,&rdquo; he replied, smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you go if you find yourself opposed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I can interest the boys sufficiently
to overcome any opposition from the Innkeeper,
if that is what you mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What if the opposition comes from other
sources?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From the members of the church?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should they interfere with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But suppose they do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go, anyway,&rdquo; he answered decidedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to hear you say that, and I trust
you will be able to help the members of the
club,&rdquo; she said quietly. &ldquo;But, there! I
really must be going. The ladies will think
I have deserted them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elizabeth smiled, and the minister followed
the smile down from her eyes to the corners of
her mouth. He made the mental observation
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
that he had never seen a more beautiful face.
As she ran lightly up the path, he watched
her, unmindful of several pairs of observing
eyes focused knowingly in his direction.</p>
<p>When the day was over, and the furniture
restored where the greater part belonged, the
&ldquo;Cleaning Bee&rdquo; gradually broke up. Captain
Pott declared to Elizabeth: &ldquo;It wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t
half so bad a day as I cal&rsquo;lated it would be,
and it&rsquo;s many a year since the old craft has
looked so neat and togged up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That evening the Captain sat on his back
doorstep, smoking his pipe, and thinking.
He thought about the transformation wrought
by the hand of women inside the house. He
heaved a sigh, and thought of Clemmie Pipkin.
If she were only able to forget all the
past and consent to his oft-repeated proposal,
but&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;He had thought that all out before,
and had brought all his persuasive powers
against the citadel of her heart, but to no
avail. A new light dawned upon him. Perhaps&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>Mr. McGowan came round the corner of
the house. The Captain rose to meet him.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Mack, how&rsquo;d you like to go out to the
<i>Jennie P.</i> with me? That&rsquo;s the name of my
power-boat out there in the harbor. I thought
it might be sort of restful to take a little cruise
after this house-cleaning typhoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a splendid idea, Cap&rsquo;n. It will
seem like old times to get aboard a vessel with
you, though it is only a power-boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, Mack, if there&rsquo;s any time I can step
in and help you pilot the salvation craft you&rsquo;ve
signed up with, just you let me know. It
ain&rsquo;t likely I&rsquo;ll be much good to you, but&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two men gripped hands. Little did
they know that night as they peacefully sailed
round the inlet just what the future was to
demand in the way of a fulfilment of that
promise.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
</div>
<p>During the following weeks Mr. McGowan
continued to grow in favor with the
people of the church and village. Every
Sunday the little chapel was crowded. His
sermons, practical in thought, simple in language,
and direct in delivery, were discussed
about the tables of the country folk during
Sunday dinner. The boys of the Athletic
Club had received him cordially, not only because
of his athletic ability, but because he
had proved himself a good fellow. Elder
Fox had strenuously opposed intimate relationships
between the club and former ministers,
but he made no attempt to interfere with
Mr. McGowan, although he remained skeptical
as to the wisdom of such secular tendencies.
Sim Hicks, the keeper of the Inn, did
not like the minister, and declared he would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
oust him from the community if it were the
last act of his life.</p>
<p>The one man who responded most naturally,
whole-heartedly, and with simple loyalty
to the power of the young man&rsquo;s personality
was Captain Josiah Pott. These two
became close companions, and one evening
Mrs. Eadie Beaver remarked concerning it:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t you glad I got him in with you,
Josiah?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cal&rsquo;late I am, Eadie. I was mad at first,
but it&rsquo;s beginning to mean a heap to me to
have him here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You always seemed so lonely when you&rsquo;d
come home, and I&rsquo;d see your light in the setting-room
window. It don&rsquo;t seem that way
now when I look across.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is real nice and homelike having him in
the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad it&rsquo;s different for you,&rdquo; declared
his next-door neighbor as she looked about the
room. &ldquo;Things look real trim since the
painters got through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The seaman&rsquo;s face clouded. &ldquo;It took a
sight more than I thought it would, though,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
and it ain&rsquo;t going to be easy to pay back to
Jim what I borrowed to do the repairing
with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, don&rsquo;t you go to crossing any bridges
till you get to &rsquo;em. The Lord will provide
when the time comes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cal&rsquo;late He might, but I&rsquo;ve always noticed
that it&rsquo;s safer to help Him a mite on the
perviding question.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, ain&rsquo;t you helping? You&rsquo;re doing
the janitor work at the church, and that helps
some. And, then, you&rsquo;ll get a ship one of
these days, mark my word. Mr. Fox said as
much to Harry just the other day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t so sure of that, Eadie,&rdquo; remarked
the Captain doubtfully. It was reasonably
clear to his mind that the Elder had a fish to
fry in thus starting reports of his willingness
to secure a command for the Captain, and it
was also reasonably clear that sooner or later
he would catch a whiff of the frying fat which
would indicate the breed of that fish. Till
then, the Captain must be content to wait.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the way, Josiah, have you heard that
the day has been all set for the installation
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
service?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Beaver. &ldquo;Mr. Fox is
arranging it, and it&rsquo;s going to be a great
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are they aiming to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, don&rsquo;t you know? An installation
service is a meeting where all the ministers of
other towns come in and say nice things about
our minister. Elder Fox says this one will be
a special one, because some one has said that
Mr. McGowan ain&rsquo;t sound in church doctrine,
being as he graduated from what is called a
&lsquo;New Theology&rsquo; school. Mr. Fox says he&rsquo;s
going to prove that ain&rsquo;t so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s all that got to do with him being a
man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess it ain&rsquo;t got much to do with that.
But you know there is a difference between
being just a man and being a real minister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Captain looked at her oddly. &ldquo;And
they&rsquo;re planning to change him from one to
the other, is that the idea?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No-o, not that exactly. But Mr. Fox
thinks it would be a good time to show all the
people that Mr. McGowan is orthodox.
There will be ministers here from everywhere.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
The Reverend Mr. Means is coming out from
New York.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they&rsquo;re all like that feller, they&rsquo;ll be a
hot lot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Josiah Pott! Haven&rsquo;t you any respect
for the cloth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not for the kind he wears, I ain&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;d
say his cloth is a sort of sheep&rsquo;s clothing, same
as the Bible speaks of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you can&rsquo;t talk decent I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t stay,&rdquo;
said Mrs. Beaver. She bridled past him, and
on into her own yard.</p>
<p>What Mrs. Beaver had said concerning
plans for the installation service was true.
Elder Fox was carrying the full responsibility,
for he wished to make this meeting one
long to be remembered. He selected with
great care those who were to sit on the council.
The Reverend Mr. Means had been
chosen for two reasons, first that he was a personal
friend of the Elder, and second because
his presence would add dignity to the occasion.
It was even arranged that the city
clergyman should be made moderator.</p>
<p>The eventful day arrived, and with it dignitaries
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
of city and countryside. It was a
fearfully hot humid day in July, one of those
days when to move about was torment, and to
work was torture. Not a breath of air stirred.
The clergymen were plainly enervated as they
descended from the various vehicles which
had conveyed them over from Little River.
The Reverend Mr. Means mopped his face as
the chauffeur assisted him from the Elder&rsquo;s
limousine. He greeted every one with deep
sonorous tones. His manner was graciously
condescending, but never once familiar. He
made his way up the steps of the chapel with
what was evidently meant for a majestic
stride, but his heavy frame turned it into a
decided waddle. He shook hands with a
chosen few, all the while looking far above
their heads as though his vision were not of this
world.</p>
<p>The Captain watched the clergyman till he
had disappeared behind the vestibule doors,
and then remarked to Mrs. Beaver, &ldquo;Them
kind ain&rsquo;t hard to sight. I could sight that
feller a mile in the offin&rsquo;, on a dark night, with
my eyes shut! If Mack McGowan was that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
kind, he&rsquo;d get to stay here about twenty-four
hours, and then he&rsquo;d smell fire and brimstone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Beaver surprised the seaman with a
wry smile and vigorous nod.</p>
<p>Mr. McGowan arrived in due season under
tow of the Elder. Mr. Fox led him before
the clergyman from the city, who was lounging
near an open window in the front of the
auditorium.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you do, Brother Fox!&rdquo; boomed
the deep voice of Mr. Means. &ldquo;And is this
the fortunate young man who has been called
to this delightful little town?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, this is Mr. McGowan. Mr. McGowan,
this is the Reverend Mr. Means from
New York City.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The studied dignity of the visiting clergyman
seemed to receive a decided shock as he
rolled up out of his chair. He stood before
the candidate to whom the Elder had introduced
him and forgot to look at the ceiling.
He had been caught off his guard, and
through the momentary look of recognition
there flitted across his flabby features an expression
that was far from ecclesiastical. But
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
it was gone as quickly as it had come, and the
Reverend Mr. Means was once more his complacent
unperturbed self.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ho! So this is our candidate? So!&rdquo; he
exploded. &ldquo;I am glad, Mr. McGowan, to
shake your hand, and perhaps we&rsquo;d better do
it now, for we might not so desire when the
grilling is over. So!&rdquo; He laughed vociferously
at his rude joke, and offered his fish-like
palm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to see you again,&rdquo; lied the candidate,
cheerfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Again?&rdquo; echoed the man, his mirth suddenly
controlled by well-feigned astonishment.
&ldquo;Again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you so soon forgotten how strongly
you opposed me last year when I was up before
the New York Presbytery for ordination?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So? Really so? Ah! Yes. I do remember,
now that you call it to mind. That
probably accounts for the familiarity of your
face. But I did not oppose you for personal
reasons, I assure you. It was because of your
radical theological beliefs. I do not allow
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
personal reasons to enter into my religious
activities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why should you have personal reasons
for not wishing to see me ordained?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just so! Just so! I did not mean to say
I had any. But, as you doubtless remember,
my brethren overruled my objections, and although
I greatly regret the theological laxity
of our Presbytery, I am willing to abide by
the decision of the majority. So!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He dismissed the two men with a wide gesture,
and dropped back into his chair. When
Mr. Fox and his charge were out of sight, Mr.
Means motioned to Mr. Harry Beaver. He
whispered in the little man&rsquo;s ear, and indicated
the groups of ministers gathered here and
there about the room.</p>
<p>Harry Beaver had the misfortune to stutter,
and in his eagerness to make himself understood
he would support himself, stork-like,
on one leg, and pump the other up and down
with frantic jerks. Mr. Beaver&rsquo;s services
were invaluable in such cases as this when
gossip was to be repeated, for his stuttering
compelled him to leave just enough unsaid to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
make his news the more startling. He was
seen slowly pumping his way from group to
group, and there followed in his wake the buzz
of low whisperings.</p>
<p>When Elder Fox later saw these signs, he
was greatly perturbed. He went directly to
the Reverend Mr. Means and demanded particulars.
On hearing what the clergymen had
to say, the Elder declared that this was neither
the time nor the place to air theological differences.
The city clergyman leaned forward to
whisper a further explanation, but was interrupted
by Mr. Beaver, who announced that he
had finished his task. Mr. Means looked at
his watch, declared it was time to open the session,
and rapped sharply for order.</p>
<p>Minor matters of business were quickly dispatched,
and Mr. Means&ndash;&ndash;according to the
prearranged plan&ndash;&ndash;was duly elected moderator.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brethren and sisters,&rdquo; he roared in his
most effective tones, &ldquo;we now come to the
most important, and, I hope, the most delightful
part of this program. We are to be favored
with a statement from the Reverend
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
Mr. McGowan, who is the candidate for installation
as pastor of this very beautiful
church. The members of the council will be
given an opportunity to question Mr. McGowan
after he has read to us his statement.
A word of caution needs to be uttered: you
are to confine your questions to theological
matters as they may affect the fellowship of
the ministers and churches represented to-day
by pastor and delegate. Mr. McGowan will
please come forward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. McGowan came forward in more ways
than one. He concisely stated his belief in
applied Christianity, and followed with a program
for future work in the village. His
short statement left the council under the spell
of an embarrassed silence. But the first question
broke the silence, and was followed by
others both new and old, which were hurled at
the head of the candidate like shots from a
rapid-fire gun.</p>
<p>Captain Pott stood the fusillade as long as
his patience permitted, and then retreated to
the quiet of the out-of-doors, where he
dragged a box into the shade of the building,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
and lit his pipe. Here Elizabeth Fox found
him, when she, too, felt the need of a little
fresh air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle Josiah, did you ever hear anything
so ridiculous? Why did you come out here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I felt sort as if I was coming up into a
reg&rsquo;lar twister, and thought it would be safer
to reef a mite and make for ca&rsquo;m waters. My
head begun to whirl, and I cal&rsquo;lated I&rsquo;d best
weigh anchor while my soundings was good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But isn&rsquo;t it bad form for you to desert like
this?&rdquo; she asked, her big eyes dancing mischievously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t exactly deserting, I cal&rsquo;late. If
I&rsquo;d been able to pitch into that crew and shake
the devil out of &rsquo;em, I&rsquo;d stayed on deck.
But&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want you to go back with me. It&rsquo;s getting
too funny to miss!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t got much hankering for them officers&rsquo;
meeting, Beth. It makes me feel
like busting chairs on their heads.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you must go back! You should hear
what he is saying to them. Come!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before the seaman could obey the summons,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
Miss Edna Splinter emerged from the rear
door. She hurried toward the two. Miss
Splinter was one of those fine spinsters which
one so often finds stranded in small villages
located near large cities. She was one of the
few friends of the Captain in Little River.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the most disgusting thing I ever saw
or heard!&rdquo; declared Miss Splinter, angrily
stamping her foot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s really too funny for words!&rdquo; exclaimed
Elizabeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What in tarnation is he doing to them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doing to them!&rdquo; flashed Miss Splinter
indignantly. &ldquo;My word! It&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re
trying to do to him. It is positively disgraceful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The seaman decided that a scene which
could have such opposite effects on two of his
best friends must at least be interesting. He
knocked the tobacco from his pipe and followed
them inside. As he listened, his interest
grew, not so much in the ecclesiastical
storm of big words, as in the wildly gesticulating
clergymen. The moderator had risen
and was rapping loudly for order.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Brethren!&rdquo; he thundered. &ldquo;It is time
that we recognize some of our laymen. I see
Mr. Harry Beaver of this church asking for
the floor. Mr. Beaver may speak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;M-Mr. Ch-chairman, does M-Mr. Mc-McGowan
b-believe in e-ev&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The unfortunate man blinked, backed,
pumped, emitted a series of hissing sounds
like escaping steam, but remained hopelessly
stuck. Those round him dodged his foot gestures,
and smiled appreciatively, while those
not engaged in trying to escape mutilation of
corns, encouragingly suggested words such as
everlasting, everpresent, etc., which might
have bearing on the subject previously under
discussion. The little man spurned them all
with vigorous backings and increased hissings.
At last, between a discouraged hiss and a triumphant
sputter, the awful word rolled out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Evolution!&rdquo; he shouted, and sat down.</p>
<p>After the laughter had subsided, the moderator
demanded that the candidate answer
the question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mr. Moderator.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Means was on his feet in an incredibly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
short time for one so bulky. &ldquo;Then, you
deny here in the face of these wise men, as you
did before your superiors in the New York
Presbytery, the creation story of the Bible?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not deny it then, and I do not deny
it now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brethren, we have the right to an explanation
from our young brother. I was denied
that privilege at the time of his ordination.
But I consider his contradictory statements so
serious a thing that I shall give you the opportunity
that was denied me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elder Fox, plainly nettled by the turn affairs
had taken, rose and demanded the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brother Fox!&rdquo; vociferously acknowledged
the moderator.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have no right to carry this senseless
discussion further. There has not yet been
sounded&ndash;&ndash;er&ndash;&ndash;the note of fellowship that
should prevail among the brethren,&rdquo; declared
the Elder, eyeing the chairman. Very gently
stroking his <a name='TC_2'></a><ins class="tnchg" title="&#34;hyphenation standardized&#34;">side-whiskers</ins>, he continued: &ldquo;We
have sprung at our young friend&ndash;&ndash;er&ndash;&ndash;as if
he were before a jury, condemned and found
guilty of a felony. Why should we trouble
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
him about things that are not fundamental to
our faith?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Pott muttered something under his
breath. Never before had he known of the
Elder and the city minister disagreeing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is the very question,&rdquo; expostulated
the moderator. &ldquo;Mr. McGowan has attacked
every sacred doctrine of the church,
for he has said what is equivalent to the statement
that my ancestors were monkeys. What
other interpretation can be given to the doctrine
of evolution? If it does not contradict
every sacred belief of our past, then I am no
theologian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old seaman chuckled, and several
shocked faces were turned in his direction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it would help if Mr. McGowan
would tell us just what he does believe in regard
to the book of Genesis,&rdquo; suggested Mr.
Fox.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the story of human redemption.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a nod of satisfied approval, the Elder
sat down, and the moderator crumpled up.</p>
<p>Captain Pott irreverently observed to Elizabeth:
&ldquo;I cal&rsquo;late that there Means is left for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
once with his sails flopping, without no idea as
to what his longitude is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A little wizened-looking man smiled cordially
and addressed the chair, but the
&ldquo;chair&rdquo; seemed oblivious to all about him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Should not the ministry of to-day place
greater emphasis on the philosophy of life
than upon time-worn theology that has come
to us from the middle ages?&rdquo; asked the man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We should preach both where they affect
life; neither where they do not,&rdquo; was the quick
response.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am an instructor in philosophy in the
high school over at Marble Point, and I was
led by your last reply concerning your belief
in the book of Genesis to believe you are somewhat
of a philosopher. Do you not think that
philosophy will touch life more quickly than
theology?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Religion is something that has outgrown
both the classroom and the cloister. It is the
anonymous religion that we must take into account
in the future if the church is to progress
with the needs of men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the voice of the Captain who broke
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
the silence of surprise which followed the unusual
statement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to know!&rdquo; came the seaman&rsquo;s exclamation
in a hoarse stage whisper.</p>
<p>Every face in the room seemed to register
the same question. Mr. McGowan smiled
and explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By anonymous religion I mean every
ideal striving for the right and truth, wherever
it is found, and by whatever name it may
be known. It may be found outside the
church as readily as within it. Wherever good
is found, the church should make use of it,
whether it is counted orthodox or not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>First one, and then another, was on his feet,
till the moderator was powerless to moderate.
Some <a name='TC_3'></a><ins class="tnchg" title="Was &#34;exclaimd&#34;">exclaimed</ins> for, and others declaimed
against, the candidate. Still others fired
broadside after broadside into all present.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t much like a heavenly craft, that
there ark, now, is it?&rdquo; queried the Captain of
his two friends. &ldquo;Smells more like brimstone
round these parts than it does like heavenly
ozone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Fox assumed command, and under his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
steady hand and head the spiritual elements
began slowly to calm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In all my life,&rdquo; he lamented, &ldquo;I have
never seen such proceedings in the house of
God. The parish committee arranged this
meeting&ndash;&ndash;er&ndash;&ndash;for the purpose of fellowship,
and you have seen fit to make of it child&rsquo;s
play. It is time for us to recognize that Mr.
McGowan is big enough, and broad enough,
to supply the needs of a community like this.
The very fact that he has not satisfied each of
your unreasonable demands is evidence that
he is competent to meet all of them, if we give
him time. I make the motion&ndash;&ndash;er,&ndash;&ndash;Mr.
Moderator, that we proceed with the installation
of the candidate without further delay or
discussion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The motion was seconded, and put to a vote.
There were only a few who had the temerity
to register themselves as negative in the face
of what the leading layman had said. Elder
Fox suggested that the vote be made unanimous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brethren,&rdquo; protested the Reverend Mr.
Means, slowly rising from the depths of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
easy chair, &ldquo;before that vote is taken to make
the will of this council unanimous, I wish to
have it fully understood that I am opposed,
bitterly opposed, to the calling of unorthodox
men to our pulpits. It is atrocious, and I
shall wash my hands of the whole affair. I
regret very much that our beloved Brother
Fox has forced me to disagree with him, and
if he is of the same opinion still, I shall have
to ask him to take the chair while the vote he
has called for is being registered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Fox took the chair, and the motion
passed without one dissenting voice. Adjournment
to the kitchen parlors followed,
and when that vote was taken the voice of him
who had washed his hands of the action of the
council was heard booming an affirmative near
the Captain&rsquo;s ear.</p>
<p>The bounteous provisions warmed heart
and stomach, and that fact, together with
some persuasion from Elder Fox, led the city
minister to the decision that he would lose
nothing if he remained to deliver his prepared
address. And he did himself proudly. Even
Captain Pott could find no fault with the impassioned
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
words of the speaker. He was
heard to remark, however, &ldquo;Them there
things he said wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t what was inside by a
damn sight, but just smeared on like honey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was late that night when the Captain
reached home after closing the church building.
The minister was in his study, and the
old man tapped lightly on the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t be disturbing your peaceful meditations
about that meeting if I come in for a
spell, will I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Assured he would not, he entered. He took
a chair on the opposite side of the table and
drew out his pipe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t no wind so fierce that it don&rsquo;t
blow you some good,&rdquo; he philosophized, as
with deliberation he scratched a match on his
trouser-leg. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d never hoped to see Jim
Fox stand up to that city feller the way he
did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you think of the whole thing,
anyway, Cap&rsquo;n?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, so far as I could get the drift, I&rsquo;d
think that there theology stuff would be
purty dry picking. But it was mighty interesting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
the way you met up with &rsquo;em at
every p&rsquo;int. I was real &rsquo;feared that Jim Fox
would get aboard their band-wagon when he
see the way things was going against you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The minister nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the way the Means feller washed his
hands! Wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t that good as a show, and then
getting up and preaching like Gabriel afterward?
Mack, you ain&rsquo;t got no idea what he
made me think of, have you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in the least. What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard a preacher tell a yarn once about
a pilot washing his hands in hell. It struck
me queer about there being a river in hell. If
it&rsquo;s as hot down there as I&rsquo;ve heard it described,
you&rsquo;d think the surroundings would
sizzle her up. But that&rsquo;s what the preacher
said about this pilot, whose last name I rec&rsquo;lect
was Pontyhouse. His stay was to be purty tolerable
long with his Satanic majesty. I&rsquo;ve
always felt sorry for that chap, seemed kind
of lonely, but as I figger it out he&rsquo;s going to
have company one of these hot days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. McGowan looked up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You just bet he is. I knew that Means
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
chap afore he took to religion, and if he&rsquo;s
slated for heavenly bliss I&rsquo;m going to put in
my papers for the other place, alongside the
scrubbing pilot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean that one of us is going to keep that
feller company in hell. Beyond that you&rsquo;ll
have to guess,&rdquo; said the Captain, rising.
&ldquo;Only don&rsquo;t you tie too tight to Means, that&rsquo;s
all. Good night, I&rsquo;m going to turn in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Cap&rsquo;n, I&rsquo;ll promise,&rdquo; replied
Mr. McGowan, smiling appreciatively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d best go to bed, too, Mack. You&rsquo;re
mighty tired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the minister did not follow his friend&rsquo;s
advice about retiring. He sat at his desk.
The angry men of the afternoon slowly faded
from his thoughts, and into the center of his
consciousness came the vision of the loveliest
face he had ever seen. He recalled the words
of frank approval with which Miss Fox had
met him after the evening service, and the cordial
manner she had shown. Not that he was
in love with one of the members of his church.
That would never do. But there was something
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
different about the Elder&rsquo;s daughter,
something which appealed to his sense of the
beautiful. This, he told himself, he could
enjoy without overstepping the conventions.</p>
<p>The next day he was to dine at the Fox
home.</p>
<hr class='toprule' />

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
</div>
<p>On the following evening, just as early as
the rules of propriety would permit, Mr. McGowan
turned into the private road that led
up to the Fox estate. He walked slowly
along the wide avenue beneath the spreading
elms and stately chestnuts. He had dined
with the Elder many times during the few
months he had been in the village, but on those
other occasions Elizabeth had been absent.
The house had always seemed cold and forbidding
both outside and inside. As he came
out of the shaded roadway into the sweeping
semicircle described before the main entrance
to the house, he caught himself wondering if
the stiff interior would seem softened by the
presence of the girl. He began at once to
chide himself for entertaining such a sentimental
notion, but before he could finish the
rebuke the door swung back, and Elizabeth
Fox stood in the opening. She was dressed
in a simple blue frock of clinging stuff, which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
set off the perfect lines of her athletic body.
The blue of her eyes took on a deeper hue as
though to harmonize with the shade of her
gown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good evening, Mr. McGowan. We are
so glad you could come. Father will be right
down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The minister&rsquo;s emotions played leap-frog
with his heart, and he stumbled awkwardly
on the upper step. He made some stupidly
obvious observation concerning the condition
of the weather as he followed his hostess into
the library. He realized that he was acting
strangely for one who had reached the supposedly
practical view of life where all sentiment
is barred from social intercourse with
the fair sex, but he also realized that he was
powerless to check the surge of what he now
felt within. With kaleidoscopic rapidity
there flashed through his mind every occasion
when he had been with Miss Fox, from the
first meeting beneath the elm-tree in the Captain&rsquo;s
yard to the present time, and he recognized
what it was that had sent scurrying his
practical views of life. He was in love, not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
with the beauty of this girl, but with her.
That love had come like the opening strains of
a grand symphony, subtly and gently disturbing
his emotional equilibrium, but with accumulative
effect the transitions had come with
the passing weeks, till now every interest in
his life seemed to be pouring out into the one
emotion he felt.</p>
<p>Elizabeth had preceded him into the library,
and was standing motionless before the
mantel. She became suddenly aware of what
was going on within the mind of Mr. McGowan,
and a shy embarrassment crept into
her eyes.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, an unreasoning determination
took possession of the minister. Unconsciously,
he began to move in her direction,
unmindful of the sound of footfalls on the
stair. Only one step remained between Mr.
McGowan and Elizabeth when Elder Fox entered
the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I trust I&rsquo;m not intruding&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Elder began nervously to stroke his
chops. His breath came heavily, shutting off
his words. A hunted look leaped into his eyes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
as he studied the tense face of the eager young
man. Could it be possible that the fears of
the Reverend Mr. Means&ndash;&ndash;privately made
known to the Elder after the installation service&ndash;&ndash;had
foundation in fact? Or had the suggestion
of Mr. Means lodged in the Elder&rsquo;s
mind, playing havoc with his imagination?</p>
<p>Mr. McGowan drew off to the far end of
the mantel, and began, figuratively, to kick
himself. He had often declared that a man in
love was the biggest mule on earth, and now
here he was, the king of them all, a genuine
descendant of <a name='TC_4'></a><ins class="tnchg" title="Was &#34;Baalam's&#34;">Balaam&rsquo;s</ins> mount with all his
asinine qualities, but lacking his common mule
sense.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; he stammered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no occasion for excuses,&rdquo; graciously
replied the girl. &ldquo;Father, Mr. McGowan
and I were&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; She paused, blushing
in confusion. &ldquo;Really, Mr. McGowan,
what were we saying?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She laughed, and it was so infectious that
the men forgot to look serious, and joined
with her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say&ndash;&ndash;er&ndash;&ndash;that you have put the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
matter in a very diplomatic way,&rdquo; observed
the Elder, apparently once more himself.
&ldquo;No explanations are necessary&ndash;&ndash;er&ndash;&ndash;I assure
you. I was once a young man, and have
not forgotten that fact. I apologize, Mr.
McGowan, if by my attitude I appeared&ndash;&ndash;er&ndash;&ndash;to
misjudge you. The trouble was with me,
not with you. An odd fancy momentarily got
the upper hand of me, and upset me for an
instant. Make yourself quite at home, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was not long till they were called to
table, and in the discussion of parish matters
the strangeness of the Elder&rsquo;s action was for
the time being relegated to the background.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have doubtless heard a hundred
times to-day how proud we all were of the
way you answered the questions yesterday,&rdquo;
commented the Elder enthusiastically. &ldquo;You
showed a fine spirit, too, sir, one&ndash;&ndash;er&ndash;&ndash;which
some of the older men might well emulate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel greatly indebted to you, Mr. Fox,
for the final outcome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Elder waved his hand as though lightly
to brush aside such words of praise, and yet
in the same movement he modestly acknowledged
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
that without his aid the young minister
could have done nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I might also add, that we are delighted
with the work you are doing at the church,&rdquo;
continued the Elder magnanimously. &ldquo;It is&ndash;&ndash;er&ndash;&ndash;very
good. Though I am still a little
dubious about your associations down at the
club, still&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father&rsquo;s ambition is to have all the pews
filled,&rdquo; broke in Elizabeth, attempting to divert
her father from a delicate topic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, my dear. That is hardly my position.
There must never be a sacrificing of principle,
even for the sake of full pews. A full church&ndash;&ndash;er&ndash;&ndash;is
not the most important part of parish
work. Am I not right, Mr. McGowan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite right, if that is the end sought in itself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am convinced from what you said yesterday
that you will furnish us&ndash;&ndash;er&ndash;&ndash;with
both. I am confidently looking forward to
one of our most prosperous years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Both?&rdquo; queried the minister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. I am old-fashioned enough to believe
in the need of&ndash;&ndash;er&ndash;&ndash;the saving power of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
the gospel. Full pews without that would
make our church the sounding of brass and the
tinkling of cymbal. We must have the old-time
power in our churches to-day, Mr. McGowan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think Little River needs reforming,
Father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is exactly the point I make: it is
more than reformation we need, it is conversion.
Take the Athletic Club, for example.
Will reform stop them? No, sir, no more
than a straw-stack would stop a tornado.
They need&ndash;&ndash;er&ndash;&ndash;a mighty thunderbolt from
heaven, and I hope that you will let God use
you, sir, as the transmitting agency.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A picture of himself occupying the place of
Zeus, holding in his hand the lightnings of
heaven, flitted through the minister&rsquo;s mind.
He smiled faintly. Elizabeth evidently
caught what was in the young man&rsquo;s mind, for
she met his glance with a merry twinkle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really, Father, don&rsquo;t you think Mr. McGowan
would look out of place as a lightning-rod,
even on Little River Church?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was speaking figuratively, my dear,&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
he replied, somewhat crestfallen that his reference
should be thus irreverently treated.
&ldquo;The boys in that club are a reckless lot, and
they are doing the work&ndash;&ndash;er&ndash;&ndash;of the devil.
They must be brought to repentance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that is fair, Father. The
church is not wholly without blame for what
those boys have done,&rdquo; declared Elizabeth
emphatically. &ldquo;What did we do to keep
them from going out and organizing as they
have?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt we did make mistakes in the beginning,
but our errors do not atone for their
sins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Father&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, Beth, never mind. We can never
agree on that point, and we should not entangle
Mr. McGowan in our differences. I
only hope he will do all in his power to make
them see the sinfulness of their ways.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Conversation turned into other channels
under the direction of Elizabeth. They were
discussing modern fiction when the door at
the end of the hall swung back with a bang
and a loud halloo echoed through the house.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
Elizabeth sprang up from her place and ran
to the dining-room door just as a tall young
man bounded through. He came up erect at
sight of the stranger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Harold!&rdquo; cried Elizabeth. &ldquo;When did
you come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just now. Didn&rsquo;t my war-whoop announce
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how did you get over from Little
River station?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Walked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you telephone? I&rsquo;d have
come over to meet you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Needed the exercise. Hello, Dad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Elder greeted the young man with a
cold nod. His hand trembled slightly as he
stiffly extended it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are just a short time at table. Will
you join us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be glad to, Dad. I&rsquo;m starved,&rdquo; he declared,
eyeing the minister as he drew up a
chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mr. McGowan, please excuse us!&rdquo;
cried Elizabeth. &ldquo;This is my brother. Harold,
this is our new minister, Reverend Mr.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
McGowan. Harold comes home so seldom
that I fear his unexpected arrival demoralized
our manners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Delighted to meet you, Mr. McGowan,&rdquo;
cordially greeted Harold. &ldquo;Heard of you
before I got in sight of the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young men gripped each other&rsquo;s hands.
Consternation took possession of the Elder.
Had his son fully understood?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. McGowan is the minister at our little
church,&rdquo; he said significantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what Beth just said. Didn&rsquo;t I say
the right thing to him, Dad? Want me to
start all over again like I had to when I was
a kid?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He eyed the minister with a curious expression
as they took their seats about the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe Dad wants me to repeat some
verses to you. Used to do it and get patted
on the head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. McGowan laughed heartily, but the
Elder showed his displeasure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will do, Harold,&rdquo; he commanded
sternly. &ldquo;I shall not allow profane jesting
about sacred things in my house.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Closet next, is it? Never mind, Dad, I&rsquo;ll
try not to shock you again. Haven&rsquo;t had
much hankering for closets since I got shut up
in that hole over in Sydney. They called it a
prison, but it was more like a potato-pit than
anything else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sydney?&rdquo; questioned the minister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Australia. You see, Mr. McGowan,
I was a real prodigal for more than two years.
Chased out to California after I graduated
from Yale, and got mixed up out there in another
fellow&rsquo;s scrape. To save my skin I
shipped on a freighter to Australia. Over
there I tried to save another poor devil from
the lock-up, and got in bad with the authorities.
Yes, I was a real prodigal, always trying
to help the other fellow out of trouble and
getting the worst end of it every time. The
only difference between me and the Bible chap
was that Father did not heap treasure on me
when I left, and didn&rsquo;t kill the fatted calf
when I returned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During this recital the Elder had fidgeted
to the end of his chair. &ldquo;I cannot see, son,
why you persist in telling of your wickedness
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
to everybody. It&rsquo;s a thing rather to be
ashamed of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I acknowledge that, Dad, but the closet
idea suggested it to my mind. Then, perhaps,
it&rsquo;s not a bad idea for Mr. McGowan to know
the worst side of me first. I spent about a
week in that hole they called a prison,&rdquo; he said
turning to the minister, &ldquo;and seven days there
couldn&rsquo;t be very easily effaced from my memory
unless I went bugs and had an awful
lapse. But the result was not so bad, for that
place proved to be my swine-pen where I
came to myself. It was just about as much
like a pig-sty as any place I ever didn&rsquo;t sleep
in.... Do you happen to know anything
about Sydney, Mr. McGowan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much. I know it&rsquo;s quite a trading
center, but most of my information is second-hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the best trading center on the Australian
coast. An odd case came to the office
from there last week. You know, perhaps,
that I&rsquo;m a member of the Starr and Jordan
law firm in New York. Well, our branch
office in Sydney referred this case to our office
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
in London, and they, in turn, sent it over
here. The reason it was transferred here is
that the documents say the client now lives in
America. I happened to be put on the case
because I knew a little about Sydney. The
same case has been up several times, it seems,
for some woman over there keeps pounding
away at it. The queer part of it is that the
trail has been followed up to a certain point
and then lost at that point every time. It is
the same old story of what is happening every
day. Relatives of a wealthy trader left Sydney
several years ago, the trader died, and the
heirs to his fortune can&rsquo;t be found. The
strange part of it is that these people can be
traced as far as America without the slightest
trouble, and then, without any apparent reason,
they suddenly drop out of existence as
completely as though they had been kidnapped
and carried to a desolate island. So
little data has been collected from the other
side that the firm has decided to send me over
to Sydney. It promises to be quite an adventure.
That&rsquo;s why I came home to-night,
Dad. I&rsquo;m leaving in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span></div>
<p>Elder Fox had been listening intently, and
at mention of the proposed trip he grew pale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;er&ndash;&ndash;should not go if I were you, Harold.
They may arrest you again. The police
of Australia have a way of remembering
things against former prisoners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know so much about the police
of Australia?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve read it, sir,&rdquo; hastily explained the
Elder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve got to go, Dad. They&rsquo;ll not
pinch me. They found the right chap before
they let me go, and couldn&rsquo;t do enough for
me when they discovered their mistake....
You say you&rsquo;ve never visited Sydney,
Mr. McGowan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was born there. But I don&rsquo;t remember
anything about the place, as we moved away
when I was a mere lad. I&rsquo;ve often heard my
father speak about it. He was a trader there
in the early days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I see your father to-night?&rdquo; asked
Harold eagerly. &ldquo;He may be able to save
me a trip over. Where does he live?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is not living. He and Mother both
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
died a few years after coming to America.
The climate was too severe for them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; apologized Harold.
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know. I&rsquo;m so anxious to get news
of this man that I rush in where angels would
fear to tread.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is perfectly all right. It&rsquo;s no more
than natural that you should think he would
be able to help you in your search.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. He could have doubtless given me
valuable information concerning the traders
of his day, and thus have put me on the trail
of my client. This man was arrested on some
charge trumped up by two scamps, but was
later released and exonerated. They&rsquo;d arrest
a man over there for looking at his own watch
if he happened to cross his eyes while doing it.
At the time when my client was in trouble the
convict-ships were in business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Elder dropped back from the edge of
his chair which he had held since the beginning
of the conversation. He gave his son a
look of dumb appeal. With an effort he
straightened and glared vacantly across the
table.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I was aboard the convict-ship <i>Success</i>
while she was in the New York harbor this
spring,&rdquo; commented the minister. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
see how civilized men could think out so many
different modes of torture and remain civilized,
let alone human.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor I. I was aboard the old tub, too.
That was the ship my client was on. It was
when she first came out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Elder was acting queerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad, what&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; asked Harold, with
concern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&ndash;&ndash;er&ndash;&ndash;nothing. Only I do wish
you would not take this trip. Can&rsquo;t you send
some one else?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid not. You see, I&rsquo;m not my
own boss. No, Dad, I can&rsquo;t get out of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harold had never seen his father so concerned
for his welfare, and it greatly affected
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They won&rsquo;t trouble me, not in the least.
To ease your mind I&rsquo;ll go under an assumed
name, if you say so. But I must get my data
at the source concerning this man Adoniah
Phillips, if&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span></div>
<p>The Elder was sipping his coffee, and
his cup fell into the saucer with a crash,
breaking both fragile pieces into fragments.
The contents were sprayed over the linen,
and drops stained the Elder&rsquo;s white waistcoat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father!&rdquo; cried Elizabeth. &ldquo;What is the
matter? You are ill!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did not answer. He turned an ashen
face toward Mr. McGowan, and with a wild
stare studied that young man&rsquo;s face. The
two men sprang to the old man&rsquo;s assistance,
but as the minister reached out his hand Mr.
Fox gave a startled cry and threw up his arm
as though to ward off a blow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go back to your seats!&rdquo; ordered the Elder
thickly. &ldquo;Do not mind me. I&rsquo;m all
right, or shall be in a few seconds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He fought helplessly for self-control.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, Dad, you must go to your room,&rdquo;
declared Harold, taking his father tightly by
the arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not ill, sir,&rdquo; answered the father, stubbornly.
&ldquo;But it might be as well for me to
retire from the table. You need not trouble,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
Mr. McGowan. I shall get on quite well with
my son&rsquo;s assistance,&rdquo; he affirmed, waving the
minister back.</p>
<p>Mr. Fox drew his handkerchief across his
perspiring forehead, and dazedly eyed the
stained cloth. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Beth, very sorry I
was so awkward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mind the cloth, Father,&rdquo; begged
the girl tearfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You remain with Mr. McGowan, Beth.
I shall soon be quite myself. Fainting spell,
I guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harold led his father from the room.
Elizabeth turned to the minister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mr. McGowan! Is it&ndash;&ndash;do you
think&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;Oh! I can&rsquo;t say it! It&rsquo;s too
awful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must telephone for the doctor at once.
It may be serious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, you do think it&rsquo;s a stroke! What
shall we do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. McGowan telephoned for the doctor,
and when he arrived he sent him at once to the
Elder&rsquo;s room. The physician entered unannounced,
stopped short on the threshold, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
stared at the two men who were in the midst
of a heated discussion.</p>
<p>Elizabeth met the doctor as he came down
the stair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Fox, will you be kind enough to tell
me if your father has had bad news, or sudden
grief?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not that I know of, Doctor. Harold
had just told him that he must start for Australia
to-morrow when Father nearly fainted.
That is all that happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, I see no occasion for this. There
is nothing organically wrong so far as I can
discover. But I shall take his blood pressure
to-morrow just to be on the safe side. Call
me any time during the night if anything out
of the ordinary happens. Keep him perfectly
quiet. Good night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harold called Elizabeth from the head of
the stair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me, Mr. McGowan. I shall send
my brother right down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please, don&rsquo;t do that. Your father will
need you both. I shall be going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry!&rdquo; she exclaimed, offering her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
hand. &ldquo;You will come again, very soon,
won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall call in the morning to inquire
about your father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you. Good night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. McGowan took his hat from the hall-tree
and left the house. As he walked very
slowly through the avenue of trees a strange
passage from the Bible kept tantalizing his
attention. &ldquo;Behold, a shaking, and the bones
came together, bone to his bone.... Then
there was no breath in them.... Then
from the four winds the breath came into
them, and they lived.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Half provoked for allowing these words to
arouse suspicion, he tried to cast them out.
But the effect of them remained. He had
witnessed the coming together of the dry
bones of a past. Were the four winds from
the four corners of the earth to give them life?
Had he unwittingly helped to furnish the dry
bones with breath?</p>
<p>He had gone but a short distance when he
heard footsteps behind him.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;One minute, Mr. McGowan,&rdquo; called
Harold Fox. &ldquo;Come with me, please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He drew the minister aside into the path
that led into the lower gardens. Once in the
deeper shadows, Harold stopped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have you to do with this man Phillips?&rdquo;
he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that? Why, Mr. Fox&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d no sooner got Dad to his room than he
began to mumble that you were to blame for
his condition,&rdquo; cut in the lawyer. &ldquo;He connected
you in no favorable way with some
woman in Australia. This man Phillips was
involved, too, from what I could gather. I
was questioning him when the doctor arrived,
and after he was gone I could get nothing
more out of him. I hate to go to Australia
with him like this, and I have every reason to
surmise that I won&rsquo;t need to go if you tell me
all you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very sorry for your father&rsquo;s condition,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
but I see no way to help you. I don&rsquo;t
see why he should connect me with his condition.
How long ago did all this happen to
your client?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About twenty-five years ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s ridiculous to associate me with
any such trouble. I was not more than born,
if, indeed, that. In what way does it all affect
your father, anyway?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I don&rsquo;t know. It&rsquo;s a mystery to
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should gladly give you aid if it were
possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m only asking that you tell me all you
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All an infant in arms would know would
be of little value, I fear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you must know something by hearsay.
Father would not take this turn out of
a clear sky. There must be a little moisture
where there are so many clouds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Mr. Fox, I&rsquo;ve told you&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here, Mr. McGowan,&rdquo; broke in Harold
impatiently, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t think me thickheaded.
I&rsquo;ve been practising law long enough
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
to smell a rat when it&rsquo;s round. Father knows
something, and he knows you know something.
In some way it involves him. His
trouble to-night was purely mental.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose I am connected with all this
mystery in some way, how on earth can a man
call on a child&rsquo;s empty memory&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re stalling, Mr. McGowan. Don&rsquo;t
try that alibi stuff with me. It simply won&rsquo;t
go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You refuse to accept my statement of ignorance
concerning this man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I most certainly do. You and Dad are
passing the buck. I thought from all reports
that you would stand up to any proposition
like a man, no matter how unpleasant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is nothing for me to stand up to,
Mr. Fox.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You absolutely refuse to tell me what you
know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I absolutely refuse, for I know absolutely
nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harold Fox studied the set features of the
minister in the dim light of the moon. He
then cordially extended his hand.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Pardon me, sir. I believe you. But
there&rsquo;s something damned crooked somewhere,
and I intend to ferret it out. If Dad&rsquo;s
in it&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;Well, I hope to the Lord he isn&rsquo;t.
You&rsquo;d better watch your p&rsquo;s and q&rsquo;s pretty
close, for Dad mentioned the fact that Mr.
Means has it in for you, and the two of them
can make it hell for you. I&rsquo;m sorry to say
that, but it&rsquo;s God&rsquo;s truth. I wouldn&rsquo;t trust
Means with a pet skunk. I never have liked
the fellow. I&rsquo;ve said too much. Good night,
and good luck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harold abruptly left, and Mr. McGowan
walked slowly and heavily from the garden
into the road that led toward the sea.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Following that night, things began to happen
with lightning-like rapidity. A spirit of
distrust and suspicion sprang up among the
members of the little church over night. The
congregations dwindled down, till within a
month they were not one-half their original
size. But in spite of the friction that was
grinding at the religious machinery, Mr. McGowan
went on steadily about his work. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
visited the Inn more frequently, and won no
little renown among the members of the club.
But here he also had his enemies, and they were
becoming bolder in proportion as the church
grew more hostile toward its minister. Sim
Hicks, the keeper of the Inn, began an open
fight against Mr. McGowan&rsquo;s intrusions, declaring
he would make good a former threat
to oust the &ldquo;Psalm-singer&rdquo; from the village.</p>
<p>One evening Mr. McGowan returned to his
study deeply perplexed. What was the
meaning in the unjust persecution? Not
that he complained; his difficulty was rather
his inability to get at the bottom of it all. He
stood before his window gazing absently out
into the gathering dusk, when Captain Pott
quietly opened the door and entered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can I come in, Mack?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d love to have you. I need company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything special wrong? I&rsquo;ve been noticing
you&rsquo;re getting awful thin of late. Ain&rsquo;t
Eadie&rsquo;s cooking agreeing with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid that food cooked to the queen&rsquo;s
taste wouldn&rsquo;t agree with me these days.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t in love, be you? I&rsquo;ve heard tell how
it affects people like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man turned toward his friend.
The wry smile with which he tried to divert
the seaman did not hide the hurt expression in
his eyes. The Captain caught the expression.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thought likely,&rdquo; he observed, pulling at
his moustache. &ldquo;But that ain&rsquo;t no reason for
you losing sleep and flesh over, unless she ain&rsquo;t
in love with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no reason why she should be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tush, tush, son. Don&rsquo;t ever try to hurry
&rsquo;em. Let her take all the time she wants.
Women are funny that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cap&rsquo;n,&rdquo; said the minister in tense earnestness,
&ldquo;there is something vitally wrong in this
town, and I can&rsquo;t seem to find out what it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; nodded the Captain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I wish you would enlighten me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cal&rsquo;late I can&rsquo;t do that, Mack. All I
can see is that there&rsquo;s something like mutiny
brewing aboard your salvation sloop, and mutiny
is a mighty funny thing. You can&rsquo;t put
your finger on it and say, &lsquo;Lo, here, or lo,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
there,&rsquo; according to scripture. Ain&rsquo;t that
right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have certainly stated the situation
much better than I could hope to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was only hoping you wouldn&rsquo;t see it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see it, and that&rsquo;s my whole trouble.
I can only see the results. I can&rsquo;t say that
this one or that one is to blame, for the thing
seems to be in the very air.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know just how you feel, Mack. That&rsquo;s
where a skipper is hog-tied against taking any
action. You just sort of feel that there&rsquo;s
something devilish afoot, but you don&rsquo;t know
enough what it is to be ready to meet it. Puts
me in mind of a song I heard once aboard one
of my ships. One of the new mates sang it,
and called it the microbe song. I ain&rsquo;t got
any idea where he picked it up, but it went
like this:</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<p class='cg'>&ldquo;&lsquo;Johnnie, don&rsquo;t you see &rsquo;em on my head and chin,<br />
All them powerful microbes, both outside and in?<br />
Johnnie, up and smite &rsquo;em, counting every one,<br />
With the strength that cometh with the pork and bun.<br />
<br />
&ldquo;&lsquo;Johnnie, don&rsquo;t you feel &rsquo;em, how they work within,<br />
Striving, crowding, pulling, kicking just like sin?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span><br />
Johnnie, don&rsquo;t you tremble, never be downcast,<br />
Gird ye for the battle, we&rsquo;ll kill &rsquo;em while it lasts.<br />
<br />
&ldquo;&lsquo;Johnnie, don&rsquo;t you hear &rsquo;em, how they speak ye fair:<br />
&ldquo;All of us are shipmates, not a bunk is bare!&rdquo;<br />
Johnnie, answer boldly: &ldquo;While we breathe we smite!&rdquo;<br />
And peace shall follow battle, day shall end in night.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>Mr. McGowan laughed heartily as the Captain
brought his song to an unmusical close.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That song ain&rsquo;t got much music in it,
leastwise not as I sung it, but it&rsquo;s got a heap
of truth. Fact is, Mack, I&rsquo;m as chuck full of
them damn microbes as you be, and I ain&rsquo;t
able to smite &rsquo;em. They are right in here,&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;he
tapped his head,&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;and though I ain&rsquo;t able
to say for sure, yet I&rsquo;ve got a purty good idea
that they&rsquo;re outside, too, and making a heap of
trouble in this here burg.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, take those pirates down to the Inn,&rdquo;
continued the seaman. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s something
brewing down there, and it smells like hell-fire
to me that&rsquo;s doing the boiling. Sim Hicks
and his gang are whooping it up a mite too
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
lively for comfort. That&rsquo;s microbe army
number one. Then, there&rsquo;s Harry Beaver.
He says they won&rsquo;t board you after your
month is up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May army number two quickly advance!
I shall gladly and willingly surrender.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey? What&rsquo;s that? Where in the name
of the ship&rsquo;s cook would you go, I&rsquo;d like to
know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right where? You board with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old seaman&rsquo;s face slowly lighted up
with appreciation as he fully grasped the
meaning of Mr. McGowan&rsquo;s words, and then
suddenly clouded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Mack. There ain&rsquo;t no sense in that,&rdquo;
he declared, shaking his head emphatically.
&ldquo;I can keep soul and body together, but
what I get on with would kill you. There&rsquo;s
worse things in the world than Eadie&rsquo;s biscuits.
No, I ain&rsquo;t going to listen to any such
out-and-out murder as my cooking would
commit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think we could hire some one
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
to come in and get our meals?&rdquo; asked the minister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m &rsquo;feared that ain&rsquo;t possible. And even
if it was it would cause more talk about town.
There&rsquo;s enough gossip aboard the old salvation
craft to sink her now, beam-fust.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should it cause talk for some one to
take care of the house for us, and get our
meals?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should any of this gab be floating
round at all? There ain&rsquo;t no sense in it, but
that don&rsquo;t stop it. Mack,&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;the Captain
leaned eagerly toward his young friend,&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;don&rsquo;t
tell me nothing you don&rsquo;t want to, but
what happened up to Jim Fox&rsquo;s house that
night you ate there the last time? Things
ain&rsquo;t been going smooth since then. I hear he
acted mighty queer. Was you to blame for
it in any way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did Harold Fox talk to you before he
left?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Harold ain&rsquo;t the gossiping kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some one has evidently been talking to
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t denying that, Mack. There&rsquo;s plenty
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
of &rsquo;em in this burg that&rsquo;s ready to talk, and
I&rsquo;d have to be deaf, dumb, and blind, not to
get some of the gab. The doctor told more
than he ought, I guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It might pay him to take a few lessons in
keeping his mouth closed,&rdquo; impatiently commented
Mr. McGowan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, Mack. I reckon he was pumped
pretty hard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t excuse him for&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, Mack, don&rsquo;t get mad. I was asking
you for your own good. There&rsquo;s something
mighty mysterious about that affair,
and I thought if you&rsquo;d tell me just what took
place that we&rsquo;d be able to do something before
that gang of rough-necks down to the Inn get
the bits in their teeth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see what the men at the Inn have
to do with all this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They ain&rsquo;t got much to do with it, except
to use it for a lever to pry you loose from the
fellers who do like you. There&rsquo;s real trouble
of some sort being hatched down there, but I
ain&rsquo;t sure just what it&rsquo;s like. Maybe there
ain&rsquo;t no use my worrying you with these suspicions,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
but watch them skunks at the Inn,
and don&rsquo;t give &rsquo;em the inside of the track.
Cal&rsquo;late you&rsquo;d best go over to supper, and see
if Harry&rsquo;s going to shut off the rations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Three days after this conversation Mr. McGowan&rsquo;s
month was up, and the hammer of
Mr. Beaver&rsquo;s authority came down. Captain
Pott stood in his door, watching the pantomime
as Mr. Beaver pumped, backed, stuttered,
and blinked out the minister&rsquo;s dismissal
from his wife&rsquo;s table. The Captain had an
extra griddle on the stove when Mr. McGowan
returned. Without question or comment
he indicated a chair, and the minister
smiled like a schoolboy as he drew it up before
the place at the Captain&rsquo;s table which he was
to occupy from now on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Best eat &rsquo;em while they&rsquo;re sizzling hot,&rdquo;
invited the Captain, dumping a turnerful of
cakes on the empty plate.</p>
<p>When the men had divided the last flapjack,
the minister announced that he was going
for a stroll along the beach.</p>
<p>He was no sooner out of sight than over
came Mrs. Beaver, carrying a large tin filled
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
with biscuits. Captain Pott took them to the
pantry, and returned with the empty pan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, Eadie. Mr. McGowan will sure
appreciate them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Josiah! I hope he won&rsquo;t blame me
for what&rsquo;s happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cal&rsquo;late he won&rsquo;t blame you,&rdquo; said the
seaman sympathetically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why are things so upset in town against
him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t able to answer that, Eadie. It
does seem that the old ark is going through
quite a squall, don&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has Harry said anything to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet, he ain&rsquo;t, and if I sight him fust
he ain&rsquo;t going to say anything. I ain&rsquo;t got
time for him to get his pumps working on
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mark my word, he will say something,
and don&rsquo;t you believe one word when
he does. I don&rsquo;t see what&rsquo;s got into him.
Somebody has bewitched him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Captain stared at her. Here were
signs of a new kind of microbe, and he could
make neither head nor tail of it. It was next
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
to the miraculous for Mrs. Beaver to espouse
an unpopular cause when there was interesting
gossip to repeat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say!&rdquo; exclaimed the seaman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do say. Hank Simpson is the only man
in this town beside you who&rsquo;s got back-bone
enough to stand by himself! He&rsquo;d struck
Harry last night if that Hicks hadn&rsquo;t held him
off. I wish he had hit him hard, maybe it
would have brought him to his senses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you trying to tell me that Harry&rsquo;s
got the gossiping fever?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not only that, but what he&rsquo;s saying is
pure lies. I can&rsquo;t see why he wants to do
other people&rsquo;s dirty work,&rdquo; complained the
unhappy woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cal&rsquo;late you&rsquo;d best give me some idea
about this here yarn he&rsquo;s spinning, so&rsquo;s I can
lay for him with a spike.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s about Mr. McGowan, and what he&rsquo;s
telling ain&rsquo;t true, and I know it!&rdquo; Her voice
broke into short dry sobs. &ldquo;He says our minister
is doing things down to the Inn that ain&rsquo;t
right. And, then, that Reverend Mr. Means
was up again the other day, and told Mr. Fox
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
something. Harry won&rsquo;t tell me what it was,
but he keeps saying it&rsquo;s awful scandalous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Eadie, if I was you I&rsquo;d quit spilling
all that brine, for it ain&rsquo;t wuth it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Josiah, it is worth it. They&rsquo;re trying
to ruin Mr. McGowan, and he&rsquo;s such a
fine man. Won&rsquo;t you stop Harry&rsquo;s talking in
some way? Won&rsquo;t you go to Mr. Fox?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me go to Jim? What in tarnation would
you have me say to him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care what you say, but make him
understand that he&rsquo;s to leave Harry alone,
and stop him telling what ain&rsquo;t so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe he&rsquo;s the one who has made Harry
believe it is so. In that case, I&rsquo;m &rsquo;feared my
views on the subject might set off some real
fireworks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you must make him believe you!
Can&rsquo;t you say something?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t sartin but I might say a thing or
two, and they won&rsquo;t be words fit for a prayer-meeting,
either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, you will speak to him?&rdquo; she asked
eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see, Eadie. Maybe I&rsquo;ll do something,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
too. But I cal&rsquo;late we&rsquo;d best begin as
Scripture says, right here at home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean you&rsquo;ll speak to Harry? What
will you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t got it all figured out yet being as
we&rsquo;re camped on this here sand-heap. If I
was aboard ship I&rsquo;d kick him down the deck
and up again, then into the hatches for a little
tonic for disobeying orders. Beyond that, I
ain&rsquo;t able to say right offhand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Beaver clutched the back of a chair.
&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t hurt my Harry! He&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;ve
got!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He ain&rsquo;t wuth boasting about, Eadie.
But being as he is all you&rsquo;ve got in the way
of earthly possession, and being as we&rsquo;re on
land, I cal&rsquo;late I won&rsquo;t do harm. But if I
was you I&rsquo;d steer him clear of these channels
for a spell till I calm down a mite.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O dear! I&rsquo;ve made a mistake coming to
you, and I hoped you&rsquo;d help me. I shouldn&rsquo;t
have told you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t argue that p&rsquo;int.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever shall I do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fust thing I&rsquo;d do,&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;suggested the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
Captain, slowly nodding his head for emphasis,&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;would
be to use a little discipline on
your fust mate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t make Harry mind any
more!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The pitiful figure gave the Captain an uneasy
feeling as he tried to return her pathetic
gaze. He replied kindly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eadie, you&rsquo;ve always held a purty tight
rein over that husband of yours, about the best
I ever see drawn over a prancing colt. You&rsquo;d
best tighten up a mite on them reins, right
sudden-like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I haven&rsquo;t any power over him now.
He&rsquo;s that worked up that I can&rsquo;t even talk to
him. He shuts me right up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that? You can&rsquo;t handle that little
shrimp?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She uttered a cry, and looked past the Captain,
through the dining-room door, into the
hall. The seaman turned in the direction of
her wild and distracted gaze. Mr. Beaver,
more wild and distracted than his spouse,
stood in the door, the incarnation of burning
passion and pent up fury.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;W-What are you d-doing in this m-man&rsquo;s
house?&rdquo; he shouted, his shrill voice breaking
into a ferocious shriek, as he blinked and
pointed at his frightened wife.</p>
<p>Captain Pott was so surprised that he
merely gaped at the infuriated little man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Harry, please don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; pleaded Mrs.
Beaver, drawing back against the wainscoting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;C-Come out of h-here!&rdquo; hissed her husband.
He brought his heel down with such
vehemence that he chipped off a splinter from
the threshold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Best stand back, Eadie, and be careful
not to touch him,&rdquo; advised the Captain, eyeing
the human cyclone with amusement and
amazement. &ldquo;Looks mighty dangerous, and
sort as if he might go off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harry met these words with a blazing
glare.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cal&rsquo;late you&rsquo;d best come in and cool off
a mite, Harry. You seem sort of het up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;W-Woman, c-come w-with m-me!&rdquo;
spluttered Mr. Beaver.</p>
<p>He strutted round the room, well out of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
Captain&rsquo;s reach, and back again toward the
door, looking for the world like a young barnyard
fowl. But his wife did not follow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She ain&rsquo;t going just yet. We was having
a quiet-like chat when you busted in here, and
I cal&rsquo;late we&rsquo;d best make it three-sided, that
is, if you ain&rsquo;t got no reasonable objection to
raise. Come, you ain&rsquo;t in that rush.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harry bounded toward the door. So, also,
did the Captain. A heavy hand fell on the
shoulder of the little man and spun him about.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s real nice of you to come in like this
for a friendly conflab,&rdquo; said the seaman, dangerously
pleasant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;M-Man, t-take your h-hand off m-me!
H-How dare y-you a-assault m-me! I&rsquo;ll
h-have the law on y-you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, Harry.&rdquo; The expression
on the Captain&rsquo;s face contrasted sharply
with his quiet words. &ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be plenty of
time for that. I&rsquo;ve been feeling real slighted
because you ain&rsquo;t been to see me for some
time. Cal&rsquo;late a little conversation will do us
both a heap of good, and clear up the air a
mite.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span></div>
<p>Mr. Beaver again started for the door, but
the Captain reached it first. He closed it,
turned the key in the lock, and put the key in
his pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, suppose you spin the yarn to me
that you&rsquo;ve been spreading round town,&rdquo; he
said, slowly filling his pipe and offering the
pouch to Harry Beaver.</p>
<p>Mr. Beaver spurned the weed of peace with
a ferocious glare. With a little coaching the
Captain brought out the story. The gist of
the matter was that Mr. Beaver considered
McGowan morally lax in the free way he was
mixing with the boys at the Inn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get this straight. Who is the feller
you&rsquo;re talking about? Just repeat his name
to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;M-McGowan!&rdquo; defiantly repeated Mr.
Beaver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When mentioning him to me,&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;requested
the Captain in a tone that made the
other man start with apprehension,&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;you&rsquo;ll
call him <i>Mr.</i> McGowan. Understand that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Beaver seemed fully to understand, for
he obeyed. When he had finished his yarn of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
sheer nonsense, Captain Pott slowly laid his
pipe on the table and his hand on the little
man&rsquo;s collar. He led him to the door, and
opened it. Harry tugged like a bull-pup on
the end of a leash, so that when the Captain
released his hold&ndash;&ndash;with ever so slight a shove&ndash;&ndash;Mr.
Beaver described a spread-eagle on the
cinder path.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you repeat that rotten truck to another
soul, I ain&rsquo;t going to be responsible for what
happens to you!&rdquo; He shot each word at the
kicking figure from between set teeth, and
brushed one hand over the other as though to
clean them of filth.</p>
<p>Mrs. Beaver ran to her husband, lifted him
out of the cinders, and patted the ashes from
his clothing. Harry Beaver stood irresolutely
for a moment, and violently shook his
fist at the man standing in the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Y-You&rsquo;ll p-p-pay for this!&rdquo; He spit out
words and cinders with gasping breath.</p>
<p>Captain Pott went inside. He washed his
breakfast dishes. He was by no means as
calm as he appeared. The whole day through
he fed the fires of his anger. That night he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
urged the minister to stay at home. He even
begged him not to go to the Inn. Mr. McGowan
asked the reason for his deep concern.
The Captain could give none, except to say
that the microbes were working overtime.
But duty called more loudly than his friend&rsquo;s
fears, and Mr. McGowan went that evening
to the Inn. An hour later the Captain&rsquo;s intuition
got the upper hand of his judgment,
and he followed.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
</div>
<p>An ominous murmur of voices, with a deep
growling undertone, floated up from the improvised
gymnasium in the basement as Captain
Pott entered the swinging doors of Willow-Tree
Inn. This was followed by a more
ominous silence. The seaman bounded down
the steps. The sight that met his gaze caused
him to stop short. On each side of the low
room men and boys were drawn up in lines,
and the division was as clean cut as though
chosen for a tug of war. The doors at the far
end of the gymnasium swung back, and a
stranger, stripped to the waist, stepped gingerly
into the room. Sim Hicks met the man,
and began to tie a pair of boxing gloves to his
hands. While the Captain looked on in utter
amazement, the doors again swung back, and
Mack McGowan entered. He did not appear
surprised at sight of the crowd, as large audiences
had become quite the common thing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
during his boxing lessons. Hank Simpson
came from out the shadows and reluctantly
tied another pair of gloves to the hands of
Mr. McGowan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What in tarnation is the meaning of this
damn exhibition?&rdquo; demanded the Captain,
turning to Jud Johnson, the plumber.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It means there&rsquo;s dirty work on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean there&rsquo;s been a crooked deal put
over on Mack?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The plumber nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who in hell&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Swearing ain&rsquo;t going to do no good,
Cap&rsquo;n. The parson don&rsquo;t stand for it down
here,&rdquo; cut in Jud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whose doing is this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got a pretty good idea who the cur
is, but we ain&rsquo;t exactly sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;d he come from?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who brung him in here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We ain&rsquo;t just sure of that, yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What in h&ndash;&ndash;&ndash; What&rsquo;s he cal&rsquo;lating to
do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He figures to lick the tar out of the parson.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
And by the blazes of the inferno, if he
does&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was plain that civil war was to ensue if
the contest went against Mr. McGowan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;d he git into such a scrape?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks like the work of that d&ndash;&ndash;I wish
the parson would let me swear for once&ndash;&ndash;Sim
Hicks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean Hicks brought him in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He come in here more&rsquo;n a week ago and
asked Mr. McGowan to give him some lessons.
Now the devil&rsquo;s to pay, and if we ain&rsquo;t
&rsquo;way off Hicks happens to be that devil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake stop asking me questions
or I&rsquo;ll cut loose and turn the air blue round
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t a feller living that can fight
Mack on a week of training,&rdquo; declared the seaman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one said he&rsquo;d had no more&rsquo;n a week of
training.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t give a tinker&rsquo;s dam if he&rsquo;s had all
the training in creation, he can&rsquo;t lick Mack
McGowan and do it fair.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span></div>
<p>Jud shot the Captain a look of approval.
&ldquo;Them kind don&rsquo;t fight fair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Jud, I don&rsquo;t see the meaning of it,
anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;re a heap sight blinder&rsquo;n I
thought. This thing&rsquo;s all fixed up to help
Hicks get the parson out of town. When
the news of this fight gets out into the
church, they&rsquo;ll oust him like a shot from a
cannon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why don&rsquo;t you fellers stop it afore
it starts?&rdquo; blazed the Captain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop nothing. Hank&rsquo;s tried it, already.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hank Simpson came across the room to
where the Captain stood, looking woe-begone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The minister says our fears ain&rsquo;t got no
foundation about that feller being crooked,
and he won&rsquo;t listen to reason,&rdquo; declared the
dejected Hank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the Almighty, he&rsquo;ll listen to me!&rdquo; exclaimed
the Captain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He wouldn&rsquo;t listen to his own mother if
she was here. He says if what we suspect is
true, he couldn&rsquo;t show the white feather now.
He&rsquo;s the best sport I&rsquo;ve ever seen, and I hate
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
to see him beat up by that white-livered
slugger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t see it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Pott started toward the ring that
was rapidly forming about the boxers. He
caught the minister&rsquo;s glance. He halted. In
that glance there was an expression which the
Captain had come to recognize and respect.
Mack McGowan was going to take his medicine,
or give it, and no one was to interfere
during the dose. The seaman dropped back
into the shadow of the stair.</p>
<p>The boxers faced each other. There was
no doubt left in the minds of the onlookers as
to the profession of the stranger as he squared
off for action. The minister recognized, too,
the trap that had been set for him, but he gave
no evidence of worry. He met the malicious
grin of the other with a friendly, but grim
smile.</p>
<p>The stranger lost no time in preliminaries.
He thought himself in full possession of the
minister&rsquo;s boxing ability, and he showed a
great amount of over-confidence. He had
studied the other&rsquo;s speed, he had spied into his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
style, he had tested his reach. Certainly, with
all this knowledge, he should have a picnic.
He had been very careful on all occasions to
appear as nothing more than a novice. He
was not unmindful of the other&rsquo;s endurance,
but hoping to make a quick end of the matter,
he tried to force the minister under full headway
at once. He went at him in a whirlwind
rush. It seemed to the observers that Mr.
McGowan must certainly be swept from the
floor.</p>
<p>But the minister was not caught off his
guard. He quickly guessed the other&rsquo;s intention.
With a swiftness that took the breath of
the onlookers, he stepped aside, drew in his
left toe under his right heel, and faced to the
right. It was done in a flash! With one long
step he swung out to the left of his adversary.
Out of the range of terrific blows, he smiled
and made a closer study of his opponent, eye
and brain alert for information. It took but
a moment, and he was facing the stranger before
the man was ready to meet him.</p>
<p>The Captain had never seen his young
friend box with greater ease, although the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
odds were against him in weight. He warded
off blow after blow with a precision that was
maddening to the other. His foot-work was
as quick as that of a cat, and as sure. Again
and again the stranger would rush in with
deadly intent, only to find himself blocked, or
to back away severely punished.</p>
<p>A breathless suspense hushed all rooting.
The minister had dropped his guard! Even
the other boxer hesitated, as though he could
not believe his own eyes. Mr. McGowan had
thrown back his head and shoulders as though
he had partially lost his foothold. The city
boxer rushed in and swung for the other&rsquo;s
heart with all his weight behind the blow.
When it was too late he saw his mistake. He
had been led into a trap, and the very movement
which had drawn the blow made it ineffective.
With lightning-like swiftness the
minister stepped forward, delivered three
blows on his opponent&rsquo;s head with bewildering
rapidity, and recovered himself with ease and
without exertion. The stranger recoiled, and
for an instant appeared to be under the impulse
to run. But blind rage seized him as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
his unexpected punishment began to sting,
and he came back like a madman. Mr. McGowan
shoved aside or blocked the terrific
shower of fists with a coolness and precision
that drove the stranger momentarily insane.
He bellowed like a mad bull. He began to
slug with the force of a pile-driver without
any pretense to fairness. He leaped from
left to right, and back again, like an orangutan
stirred to frenzied anger. Mr. McGowan
tried to stop him by calling time, but
with a foul oath he shot a stiff arm into the
minister&rsquo;s abdomen. Decidedly jarred, Mr.
McGowan swayed back under the impact of
the foul, but recovered his footing in time to
meet the other with a blow full in the face.
The stranger rushed in again, but Mr. McGowan
ducked, landed his glove with a heavy
jar on his adversary&rsquo;s body, and cut the man&rsquo;s
lip with a right swing as he sprang to safety.</p>
<p>The sight and smell of his own blood sent
the city pugilist into a crazed frenzy. He
threw his elbow into the minister&rsquo;s throat and
hurled him against the wall. Holding him
there as though in a vise he landed a wicked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
hook under the left ear. Sim Hicks gave an
immoderate laugh. A shout went up from
the few who favored the stranger. A deep
growl was the answer from Hank Simpson
and his following as they sprang forward.
They seized Mr. McGowan, tore him away
from the maddened pugilist, and led him to a
box. Hank steadied him while Jud Johnson
massaged the bruised neck and bathed the
bleeding ear. Sim Hicks crossed to where
they were at work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you got enough?&rdquo; he asked with a
sneer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! And by thunder, you ain&rsquo;t got all
that&rsquo;s coming to you, neither,&rdquo; growled Jud.</p>
<p>Mr. McGowan leaned heavily against
Hank Simpson. As it was apparent that his
mind was beginning to clear, Sim Hicks came
closer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you ready to call quits and stop your
damned <a name='TC_5'></a><ins class="tnchg" title="Was &#34;medding&#34;">meddling</ins> in my affairs?&rdquo; persisted
the Innkeeper.</p>
<p>Mr. McGowan shook his head, slowly.
Then, with a start, he straightened. Between
the uprights of the stair-banister he had see
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
two faces peering down into the room. As his
vision cleared a little more he saw that one
face was set between silky chops.</p>
<p>Captain Pott had not taken his eyes from
the minister&rsquo;s face, but now he followed the direction
of his startled gaze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it ain&rsquo;t that damned menagerie, Fox
and Beaver!&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of the two figures slipped up and out.
The other, deeply engrossed, did not budge.
The Captain gave a mirthless chuckle and
quietly crept up the stair. He seized the
heels of Mr. Beaver, dragged him bumping
down the stair, and dropped him beneath one
of the lights. He gripped the little man&rsquo;s collar,
glanced menacingly into the distorted
face, and remarked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Paying off some of them infernal debts
you spoke of?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;L-Let m-m-me g-go! L-Looking&rsquo;s
f-f-free, ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; His thin voice rose with
each word till it reached a hissing shriek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, the show seems to be free. And if
I&rsquo;m any judge, it&rsquo;s just begun, so you may
as well come down for it all.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span></div>
<p>Sim Hicks was swearing so loudly that the
seaman turned in that direction. The Innkeeper
was shaking his fist in the minister&rsquo;s
face. Captain Pott dragged the squirming
Beaver across the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here, Sim, you&rsquo;d best shet that trap-door
of yours, it&rsquo;s letting out too much blue
smoke, and the dominee don&rsquo;t permit swearing
among the boys. Cal&rsquo;late I can give
you some assistance if you&rsquo;re needing it,&rdquo;
said the seaman, coming uncomfortably
near. &ldquo;As for that there slugger of yourn,
he&rsquo;s nothing but a white-livered cur of a
coward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You take back those words, or I&rsquo;ll make
you swallow them one at a time!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The threat came from the city pugilist, and
the Captain swung about to face him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This here is my friend you hurt,&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;the
seaman&rsquo;s eyes flashed with fury as he jerked
his thumb toward the minister,&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;and I
cal&rsquo;late you&rsquo;d best apologize for what you&rsquo;ve
done to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you doddering old idiot! If you
didn&rsquo;t want your little pet hurt, you&rsquo;d best
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
have kept him home. I understand he&rsquo;s your
special hobby.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d best apologize,&rdquo; repeated the Captain
in dangerous calm.</p>
<p>The pugilist laughed hoarsely. &ldquo;When I
do it will be in a hotter place than where we
are to-night. I did nothing&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t lie to me! I see what you done.
Either you fight like a man,&ndash;&ndash;even if you
ain&rsquo;t one,&ndash;&ndash;or by the lord Harry&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>For emphasis he clutched the collar he still
held, and Mr. Beaver squirmed as though in
fear of being hurled bodily into the face of the
city boxer. Sim Hicks sprang at the Captain&rsquo;s
throat with a fierce leap and an angry
growl. But Sim picked himself up from a
corner and rubbed the blood from his streaming
nose. The sight of the cringing Innkeeper
seemed to have a temporary effect
upon the pugilist, but he quickly recovered
and bristled defiantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You damned city cur! If you don&rsquo;t fight
fair I&rsquo;ll measure you out on the same spot!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You go to the devil!&rdquo; said the man with a
sneer.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;When I do I&rsquo;ll take a white-livered, yellow-haired
cur along. You take that grin off
your face and stand up to Mack like a man.
I&rsquo;ll act as pilot from now on, and if I sight any
more of your dirty tricks, may the Lord have
mercy on you, for I won&rsquo;t. Pitch in!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two men obeyed and faced each other.
Except for a slight tightening of the lips, Mr.
McGowan gave no sign of having suffered
from the severe punishment because of the
other man&rsquo;s foul. Those who had been standing
about the box, now jostled the other faction
out of the ring, and pressed closely about
the Captain.</p>
<p>During the next fifteen minutes the boxers
worked swiftly. Although the stranger had
publicly defied the seaman&rsquo;s orders to fight
fair, yet it was apparent to all that he was
obeying them. Only once did he attempt a
foul. The Captain&rsquo;s quick eyes saw, and with
a thundering command that shook the room
he checked the pugilist&rsquo;s stiff arm movement
to the throat. Then the end came. Mr. McGowan
brought forward his head and shoulders
with his usual lightning-like swiftness in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
order to draw a lead before the other was prepared
for it, and at the same time he accompanied
the movement with a quick jerking
back of his left hand as though suddenly
changing his mind. The city man did the rest.
He halted. Mr. McGowan stepped to the
left just as the other delivered his spent blow,
and with the added weight of his moving body
landed his right glove against the stranger&rsquo;s
ear. This was quickly followed with a crashing
upper-cut to the heavy jaw. There was a
loud rending and ripping of splintered wood
as the big man fell through one of the thin
panels of the partition. He slid to the floor
and lay motionless amidst the wreckage.</p>
<p>Sim Hicks bawled at him to get up and go
on with the fight. Mr. Beaver squirmed and
whined under the tightening grip like a
beaten pup. The crowd stood dumb with
amazement. Few of those present had ever
witnessed the effect of a knock-out blow.</p>
<p>Mr. McGowan was the first to the side of
the prostrate man. He lifted him to his feet,
and began walking him about. As the
stranger regained his senses, he smiled faintly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
at Hicks&rsquo; repeated requests that the fight be
finished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long was I out?&rdquo; asked the pugilist.</p>
<p>Sim caught the savage glare in the Captain&rsquo;s
eyes, and reluctantly admitted that it
had been over a minute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this ain&rsquo;t no regular match!&rdquo; he
shouted.</p>
<p>The pugilist looked in the direction of the
Captain as he drew away from the minister
and steadied himself against an upright.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess we&rsquo;ll have to call it regular
enough to go by rules,&rdquo; declared the city
boxer. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m beaten, Hicks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was sorry to do it, but there seemed no
other way. There was too much at stake to
run the risk of losing,&rdquo; said the minister.
&ldquo;May I say, sir, that you are a good
boxer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. McGowan,&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;the stranger extended
his hand with unaffected cordiality,&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;it&rsquo;s
great of you to say that after what I tried to
do to you. I refused to apologize when that
old fellow tried to make me, but I do it now.
I&rsquo;m ashamed of the way I lost my head. If
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
you&rsquo;ll accept my apology, I&rsquo;ll accept your
compliment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gladly!&rdquo; exclaimed the minister.</p>
<p>Beneath the rough exterior of this savage
fighter there was the spirit of the true sportsman.
The two men removed their gloves and
gripped bare hands in a warm grasp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fact of the matter is, you had me outclassed
at every turn. Any man who could do
what you have done to-night, after I&rsquo;d
thought I&rsquo;d spied on you long enough to secure
the key to all your strong points, could
make his fortune in the ring. I&rsquo;m heartily
ashamed that I made myself a party to this
plot to put you out. What your old friend
has said is true: I&rsquo;m a cur and a white-livered
coward to sneak in on you the way I did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here!&rdquo; shouted Sim Hicks, abandoning
all caution, &ldquo;ain&rsquo;t you going to finish this
little job you&rsquo;ve been paid for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is finished, but it wasn&rsquo;t stipulated in
the contract as to who was going to do the
finishing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shet that trap of yours, Sim. If you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
don&rsquo;t it&rsquo;s li&rsquo;ble to get another catch,&rdquo; threatened
the Captain.</p>
<p>Hicks eyed the seaman, rubbed his swollen
nose, and backed away.</p>
<p>Mr. Beaver did a corkscrew dance, and
tried in vain to release the hold on his collar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cap&rsquo;n Pott!&rdquo; exclaimed the surprised
minister who noticed for the first time that
the seaman was holding Mr. Beaver. &ldquo;What
on earth are you doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, this little shrimp was mighty interested
in the boxing, and I thought he might as
well come down for a few lessons that he
wouldn&rsquo;t forget right off. I cal&rsquo;lated to give
him a few myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Beaver&rsquo;s face was purple. His words
would probably have been of the same hue had
there been any possibility of releasing them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him go, Cap&rsquo;n, you&rsquo;re strangling
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;d otter be choked, if he&rsquo;s as deep in
this thing as I think he is. But he ain&rsquo;t in no
condition for a lesson to-night, he&rsquo;s a mite too
worked up. Harry, I&rsquo;ll let you off, but if this
here yarn gets out into the church through
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
you or through the rest of the menagerie,
we&rsquo;ll give you the little lesson I spoke about,
and it will stick like glue to your anatomy.
Now, you run along to Eadie, she&rsquo;ll be missing
you, and I&rsquo;d hate to send you home
mussed up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Beaver ran. With a dart he shot for
the stair.</p>
<p>The members of the club escorted Mr. McGowan
to the Captain&rsquo;s home. As he said
good night, Hank Simpson came forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. McGowan, the fellers want to know
if you&rsquo;ll be one of our members in regular
standing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. McGowan expressed his delight, and
declared he would like nothing better.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s &rsquo;lected, fellers!&rdquo; shouted Hank.</p>
<p>A ringing cheer went up from the crowd.
The Captain said to Elizabeth the next morning,
when recounting what had taken place,
&ldquo;I was &rsquo;feared that Mack would be mad as
hops the way them fellers carried on, but he
wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t, not a mite. He seemed tolerable
pleased about it. When the fellers asked a lot
of foolish questions as to what was the matter
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
with Mr. McGowan, and then answered them
by saying that he was all right, Mack looked
as happy as a school kid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hank once more whispered to the minister.
The answer was apparently satisfactory, for
the boys gave a parting cheer, declaring that
they would all be present in church the following
Sunday.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
</div>
<p>The troublesome microbes, of which Captain
Pott had so unmelodiously sung, had
been driven out into the open, and were now
doing a war-dance to a jazz tune. Into the
domestic life of the Captain there wormed the
most subtle microbe of all. Just what to do
with it, or how to meet it, he did not know.
But it continued to bob up at every meal time
with a clamorous demand for attention.</p>
<p>One Monday evening the two men sat in
the minister&rsquo;s study, the clergyman wrapped
in silence, and the Captain in a cloud of tobacco
smoke. The seaman was the first to
break through his cloud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mack, I&rsquo;m awful sorry to disturb your
meditations, but if they ain&rsquo;t a heap sight
more entertaining than mine, I cal&rsquo;late you
won&rsquo;t mind to give &rsquo;em up for a spell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t be much of a sacrifice,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
Cap&rsquo;n,&rdquo; acknowledged Mr. McGowan, laughing.
&ldquo;What is troubling you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s this,&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;the Captain blew a
cloud of smoke,&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;this here&rsquo;s slow navigating
on land without a woman&rsquo;s hand on the wheel.
We need some one to set things to rights
round here once in a while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. McGowan had been lounging lazily before
the open fire, but now rose and stretched
himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The idea is all right, but how can we put
it into effect?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t just exactly sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must have something to propose, else
you wouldn&rsquo;t have mentioned it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t going to be no proposing,
leastwise not by me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The minister smiled. &ldquo;Afraid of the fair
sex, Cap&rsquo;n?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Just wise to &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you take the suggestion I
made some time ago?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meaning, which?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have some one come in once a week to
clean up.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;It needs something more than a cleaner
round here. What we want is a cook. I
cal&rsquo;late we&rsquo;d best ship a general housekeeper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A housekeeper!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. McGowan,
suddenly breaking off a wide yawn.</p>
<p>The skipper blew a cloud of smoke and
watched it thin out into the air above his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you have just declared that you
didn&rsquo;t intend to propose. I&rsquo;m afraid&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t interested in your fears, young
man. I&rsquo;m too old a sea-dog for any of them
new-fangled tricks. But being as you&rsquo;re set
on staying here I&rsquo;ve decided that we&rsquo;ll take a
woman aboard to look after the mess and
swab decks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The minister became serious. &ldquo;Is that
practical in our present position?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Practical in our present position? If it
ain&rsquo;t, then I&rsquo;d like to know when in the name
of all my ancestors such a thing is practical.
Mack&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean from the financial point of view.
The boxing match seems to have hit the
pocketbooks of the church members harder
than the man from the city hit me. At least,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
something has given them almost total paralysis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s asking you to consarn yourself
with a woman&rsquo;s keep? I ain&rsquo;t, be I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you don&rsquo;t think that I&rsquo;d permit
you to bring a housekeeper in here for me unless
you give me the privilege of sharing in
the expense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mack, this here place ain&rsquo;t your house.
Cal&rsquo;late I&rsquo;ll do about as I please on that
p&rsquo;int.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I can&rsquo;t stand the expense with part
salary, you certainly can&rsquo;t stand it with none,&rdquo;
persisted the minister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t sartin it would cost anything.
Leastwise, it won&rsquo;t cost much. I ain&rsquo;t sartin,&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;repeated
the Captain as though in meditation,&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;but
I think she&rsquo;ll come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let your cur&rsquo;osity get away with
you, young feller. I ain&rsquo;t promising nothing,
but I&rsquo;m just thinking, that&rsquo;s all. How&rsquo;d you
like to cruise round the P&rsquo;int to-morrow,
Mack?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have a delightful way of changing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
the subject when it gets too hot. But I&rsquo;d certainly
like the cruise and the air.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cal&rsquo;late I ain&rsquo;t changed no subject.
We&rsquo;ll go over Riverhead way. It&rsquo;ll be sort
of a vacation from all this mess, and give me
a chance to see about this puzzling woman
question.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With this declaration, the Captain retreated
into a silence which all of Mr. McGowan&rsquo;s
questions failed to penetrate. The
old man was thinking of Clemmie Pipkin!</p>
<p>Clemmie had been the object of his boyhood
ardor till the day when his dashing half-brother
had kidnapped her affections. But
no sooner had he won her from the Captain
than he disappeared, leaving the faithful Miss
Pipkin, never to return. She had remained
unmarried all these years, in spite of the oft-repeated
attempt on the part of Captain Pott
to rekindle her love. He wondered now, as
he sat before the dying fire, if her presence in
his home would change her attitude toward
him. This question wakened anew the desire
of his youth, and after he had retired it kept
sleep from his eyes through the long hours of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
the night. He must have Clemmie Pipkin to
take care of his house.</p>
<p>Daylight had barely kindled her fires over
the eastern waters when the two men boarded
the <i>Jennie P.</i> Mr. McGowan noticed that
the Captain took particular pains in cleaning
and polishing the few brass trimmings. They
both worked hard till the sun appeared, and
then hastily ate a lunch which they had
brought aboard with them. After finishing
the sandwiches, the Captain went forward
and dropped a measuring-stick into the gasoline
tank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll swan!&rdquo; he ejaculated. &ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t
a drop of &rsquo;ile in that there tank. And I left
the cans ashore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go for them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you don&rsquo;t, young feller! You stay
right aboard here,&rdquo; ordered the skipper.
&ldquo;You can be working on the engine, or something.
I&rsquo;ll get that &rsquo;ile myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Surprised at the seaman&rsquo;s earnestness, the
minister obeyed. He was working over the
engine, his hands covered with grease, when
the dory scraped the side of the boat. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
came out of the cockpit, and, to his amazement,
saw the Captain assisting two young
ladies into the <i>Jennie P.</i> Each carried a
large basket. They were no less surprised
than he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Mr. McGowan!&rdquo; exclaimed Elizabeth,
the color flooding her already rosy
cheeks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain Pott!&rdquo; cried Miss Splinter.</p>
<p>Mr. McGowan said nothing. He folded
his hands behind him and looked foolish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought maybe a little company might
liven up the trip,&rdquo; observed the seaman, looking
like a schoolboy who had sprung a surprise
on his teacher. &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t you going to welcome
&rsquo;em? You&rsquo;ll find their name on the roster,
and they brought their grub with &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a very delightful surprise,&rdquo; faintly
declared the minister.</p>
<p>Elizabeth looked troubled, and her discomfort
did not add to the minister&rsquo;s ease. She
had been anything but cordial since the incident
at her home when Mr. Fox had taken
ill. He had not seen her since the fight. He
feared that the interpretation placed on that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
by her father had not bettered his standing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t go to bed last night right off,
Mack, when I said I was going,&rdquo; explained
the Captain. &ldquo;I went out and fixed up this
little party for a sort of surprise to all hands.
I stowed that &rsquo;ile in the boat-house on purpose
so as I could get ashore without too many
questions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I trust that our going will make no difference.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The minister&rsquo;s embarrassment had grown
painful. With a hopeless gesture he brought
out a pair of black grimy hands. &ldquo;Indeed, it
will make a difference, Miss Fox, all the difference
in the world. If the Captain had kept
his engine cleaner I&rsquo;d have been able to give
you a more hearty welcome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sight of the greasy hands broke the
tension, and although Mr. McGowan cordially
extended them neither young lady offered
hers in return.</p>
<p>The cruise was a great success, if we take
the Captain&rsquo;s word for it, which word was
given to Mrs. Beaver on their return to Little
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
River. &ldquo;Them young folks had the time
of their lives, and I never see a more likely
pair than that little Beth and the minister as
they stood by the wheel together steering the
<i>Jennie P.</i> through them rollers. Beth takes
to water just the same way she takes to everything,
with her whole soul.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was noon when they cast anchor in the
Riverhead Inlet. The men prepared to go
ashore while the girls took out the lunches.
As the baskets were opened, and bundles untied,
Mr. McGowan suggested that they make
for shore before their appetites demanded
otherwise.</p>
<p>At the landing the men parted, for the Captain
had expressed the desire to make his visit
alone. He did not tell the minister that his
destination was the County Farm for fear
that he, Mr. McGowan, would not understand
that Clemmie Pipkin was the matron,
and not an inmate.</p>
<p>Captain Pott found Miss Pipkin without
difficulty. During the past ten years, he had
been a frequent visitor at the Farm, and many
knew him. He went at once to the bare little
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
reception-room and made known his presence.
As Miss Pipkin entered a slight tinge crept
into the hollow of her sallow cheeks. She extended
a bony hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m real glad to see you, Josiah. It&rsquo;s
been a long time since you called.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Howdy, Clemmie. It has been a mite
long, but I&rsquo;ve been purty busy of late trying
to keep people out of trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you must have changed a lot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t looking well,&rdquo; he observed solicitously.
&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t sick, be you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she answered with a deep sigh.
&ldquo;That is, I ain&rsquo;t real sick. I ain&rsquo;t been feeling
quite myself for a spell, but I reckon it
will wear off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll wear off if you don&rsquo;t get out of
this place,&rdquo; replied the Captain.</p>
<p>Miss Pipkin was far from being a beautiful
woman. From all appearances she had never
been pretty, or even good-looking. Her form
had a few too many sharp angles where it
should have been curved. Her face was long
and thin, and now age and worry had dug
deeply into the homely features, obliterating
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
the last trace of middle life. She always
dressed in black, and to-day the Captain saw
that her clothes were worn and faded. He
moved uneasily as his quick eye took in the
meaning of these signs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cal&rsquo;late they&rsquo;re working you too hard
here, Clemmie,&rdquo; he said tenderly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d
best get away for a spell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to have a rest, but I can&rsquo;t leave.
There&rsquo;s no one to take my place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pshaw! There&rsquo;s plenty who&rsquo;d be glad for
the place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyhow, I ain&rsquo;t got no place to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve come to see you about,
Clemmie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Pipkin straightened with cold dignity,
and her eyes flashed fires of warning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Josiah Pott! Be you proposing to me
<i>again</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, don&rsquo;t get mad, Clemmie. I ain&rsquo;t
proposing to you,&rdquo; he explained as calmly as
possible. &ldquo;But as I&rsquo;ve said afore&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know what you&rsquo;ve said, learnt it like a
book. And you know what I&rsquo;ve said, too.
My no means <span class='smcaplc'>NO</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I cal&rsquo;late you ain&rsquo;t left no room for me to
doubt that. You&rsquo;ve made that purty tolerable
plain. I reckon we&rsquo;re getting too old for
that now, anyway. Leastwise, I be,&rdquo; he finished
hurriedly, noting a rising color in her
thin cheeks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; she grunted indignantly. &ldquo;A
body&rsquo;d think you was the grandfather of Methuselah
to hear you talk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am getting on purty well, Clemmie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Josiah Pott! If you come over here to
talk that nonsense you can go right back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really come on another matter. I want
you to come over and keep house for me and
another man. We&rsquo;re living on the old place,
and it ain&rsquo;t what you&rsquo;d call hum sweet hum for
two males to live alone in a big house like
mine. Thought maybe you wouldn&rsquo;t mind
keeping the decks swabbed and the galley full
of pervisions if I&rsquo;d only pay you the same as
you&rsquo;re getting here. I&rsquo;d&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will be enough!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thought maybe &rsquo;twould.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not listen to another word from you!&rdquo;
exclaimed the shocked Miss Pipkin. The expression
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
on her face gave the Captain the feeling
that he had dived into icy water, and had
come up suddenly against a hidden beam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two of you! And you want me to do
your work! Well, of all the nerve!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t told you yet who the other feller
is,&rdquo; suggested the Captain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care if he&rsquo;s an angel from heaven.
I&rsquo;d think you&rsquo;d be ashamed of yourself to
come here and speak of such a thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I ain&rsquo;t ashamed, Clemmie. A drowning
man is willing to grab the first straw he
sees. Listen to me, Clemmie,&rdquo; he pleaded, as
she turned to leave the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me listen to you proposing for me to
come over to Little River and start talk that
would ruin the town? Not if I know what
Clemmie Pipkin&rsquo;s doing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you I ain&rsquo;t proposing to you, I&rsquo;m
just asking you. As far as that town goes, a
few things more for it to talk about can&rsquo;t do
her no harm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Pipkin paused on the threshold to
give a parting shot, but the Captain spoke
first and spiked her guns.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;The other feller happens to be the new
parson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her expression changed. Preachers had
long been her specialty at the Poor Farm, and
she knew exactly the care and food they
needed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was that you said, Josiah?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The other feller living with me is the minister
at the brick church.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The minister living with you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With you? But you ain&rsquo;t got religion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cal&rsquo;late that&rsquo;s the safest guess you ever
made, Clemmie, but just now it&rsquo;s cooking, and
not religion, that&rsquo;s bothering me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lan&rsquo; sakes! You ain&rsquo;t trying to cook for
the minister, be you?&rdquo; she asked incredulously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You put it just right, I&rsquo;m trying to. I
don&rsquo;t know how long he&rsquo;ll be able to stand it,
but he won&rsquo;t go nowhere else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor thing!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Poor
thing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Them&rsquo;s my sentiments, too, Clemmie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And no doubt he&rsquo;s a frail creature, too,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
and ought to have the best of care. So many
of them are that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A violent fit of coughing seized the Captain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lan&rsquo; sakes! Now, what&rsquo;s the matter with
you? Been going out without your rubbers,
I&rsquo;ll warrant. Men are worse than babies
when left to themselves. I do believe they&rsquo;d
die if the women-folks didn&rsquo;t look after them
once in a while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We sartin would,&rdquo; choked out the Captain.
&ldquo;Do you suppose you can arrange it to
come over?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When do you want me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right now. To-day. I come special for
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go,&rdquo; decided Miss Pipkin impulsively.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s plain as day that it&rsquo;s my duty. I am
getting wore out in this place. They&rsquo;ve been
putting the work of three on me, and I ain&rsquo;t
got the strength.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t right, Clemmie, for you to be
wearing yourself out in this kind of work.
God intended you for something better. I
ain&rsquo;t proposing,&rdquo; he hastily added, lest his bird
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
take the sudden notion to wing her way back
into the bush.</p>
<p>Miss Pipkin gave him a quick look, and
left the room. She very soon returned carrying
a bundle beneath one arm, and clutching
a bulging telescope suit-case in the other
hand. From one end of the bundle protruded
the head of a cat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What in tarnation you got in there,
Clemmie?&rdquo; asked the seaman, pointing
toward the bundle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t think I was going to leave my
Tommy behind to be starved and abused, did
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t thought about that,&rdquo; meekly admitted
the Captain, as he took the telescope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you got a trunk to send over?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Pipkin breathed a deep sigh of relief
as they passed out of the gates. She looked
back at the weather-beaten old buildings of
the County Farm into which ten years of her
life had gone. But she felt no pang on leaving.</p>
<p>The Captain kept up a constant stream of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
conversation on the way down to the wharf.
Suddenly, Miss Pipkin stopped, and suspiciously
eyed the seaman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Josiah, how are we going back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In my <i>Jennie P.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In your what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In my power-boat, the <i>Jennie P.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Josiah Pott! You know I ain&rsquo;t been
aboard a boat for more than twenty year, and
I ain&rsquo;t going to start out on the thing, whatever-you-call-it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It appeared as if the Captain would have
to come another day, in another sort of vehicle,
to carry home his newly-found housekeeper.
He again led trumps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The minister come all the way over with
me to get you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sartin did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor thing! He&rsquo;s been treated so scandalously
that he&rsquo;s willing to do &rsquo;most anything.
Well, it may be the death of me, but
I&rsquo;ve got this far, and I may as well go on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. McGowan was waiting for them at the
end of the wharf. The skipper introduced
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
them with a malicious wink at Miss Pipkin as
he indicated the physical strength of the minister.
Her face flushed as nearly crimson as
it had in years. When they finally got into
the dory she leaned close to the Captain and
set his staid old heart palpitating. Mr. McGowan
was engaged, waving to the girls in
the <i>Jennie P.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t going to tell him what I said
about his being delicate, and the like, are you,
Josiah?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He answered with a vigorous shake of the
head as he leaned back to draw the oars
through the water. Each time he swung forward
he looked into the eyes of Miss Pipkin.
Did he imagine it, or did he see there something
more than interest in her own question?</p>
<p>Aboard the <i>Jennie P.</i> the young ladies took
charge of Miss Pipkin, and soon they were
chatting companionably. The girls had removed
the door to the cabin, and laying it
from seat to seat, had improvised a table.
Over it they had spread cloths, and on the
cloths were plates piled high with good things.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
The odor of coffee greeted the Captain&rsquo;s nostrils,
as he came forward after securing the
dory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;d like to know! Where in tarnation
did you get the stove to b&rsquo;ile the coffee
on?&rdquo; he asked, sniffing the air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We brought it with us,&rdquo; replied Elizabeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You fetched a stove in them baskets?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly. Come and see it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She drew her old friend toward the cockpit.
There stood the steaming coffee-pot
over an alcohol flame.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I swan!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Paper plates were scattered about over the
improvised table, chicken piled high on some,
sandwiches on others, doughnuts, cream-puffs,
and apple tarts on still others. Indeed,
not a thing had been left out, so far as the
Captain could see.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If this ain&rsquo;t the likeliest meal I ever see,
then, I&rsquo;d like to know. I feel right now as if
I could eat the whole enduring lot, I&rsquo;m that
hungry,&rdquo; declared the skipper.</p>
<p>Elizabeth served, moving about as gracefully
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
as a fawn. Mr. McGowan watched her
with no attempt to hide his admiration. The
one question in his mind all day had been:
what did she think of him for his part in the
affair at the Inn? He decided that he would
take advantage of the first opportunity to
prove to her that no other course had been
left open for him.</p>
<p>Dinner over, the Captain filled his pipe,
and stood in the door of the cabin. He
smoked quietly, and watched the ladies put
the things away. Miss Pipkin was folding
the cloths, and on her the seaman&rsquo;s gaze came
to a rest. Would the old home seem different
with her in it?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t we better start?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Captain jumped. &ldquo;I cal&rsquo;late I&rsquo;m
getting nervous, jumping like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or in love?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe you&rsquo;re right, Mack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Honest confession?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t confessing nothing. I was referring
to your idea that we&rsquo;d best be under
way,&rdquo; explained the Captain, with a wry
smile.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span></div>
<p>As he spoke he leaned over the engine, and
gave it a turn. Tommy, Miss Pipkin&rsquo;s black
cat, was mincing contentedly at some scraps
when the chug-chug of the exhaust shot from
the side of the boat. Tommy shot from the
cockpit. He paused on the upper step, a
startled glare in his eyes. He forgot the
tempting morsels; he forgot his rheumatism;
he was bent on flight. And fly he did. With
a wild yodeling yell he sprang forward. Like
a black cyclone he circled the deck. On his
fourth time round he caught sight of the minister&rsquo;s
legs. He and Elizabeth were standing
at the wheel, ready to steer the boat out of the
harbor. To the cat&rsquo;s excited glance the man&rsquo;s
legs suggested the beginnings of tree trunks,
at the top of which there was safety and repose
from the spitting demon at the side of
the boat. Like a flying bat he made the leap.
But he had misjudged both the distance and
his own rheumatic muscles. He landed on the
girl, and came to a rest half-way to her shoulder.
His claws sank into the thick folds of
her sweater. Elizabeth released her hold on
the wheel, and with a cry fell back against the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
minister. A pair of strong arms lost neither
time nor opportunity. With a little persuasion
Tommy saw his mistake, and dropped to
the deck. He took up his interrupted flight,
finally coming to an uncertain rest somewhere
aloft.</p>
<p>Elizabeth looked up, smiled, blushed like a
peony, took hold the wheel, and gently released
herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, thank you! Wasn&rsquo;t it stupid of me
to let that old cat frighten me so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. McGowan declared that he was delighted
to have been of service, and his emotions
began to be very evident to him.</p>
<p>It took considerable coaxing on the part of
the Captain, and more clawing on the part of
Tommy, before he could be convinced that the
cabin was as safe as the mast. At last he gave
in and came down, and as the boat left the
harbor he was purring contentedly, folded
safely in the arms of Miss Pipkin.</p>
<p>Before they reached Little River harbor,
Miss Pipkin had many times declared she was
going to die. The Captain as many times
remonstrated with her, but she only showed a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
greater determination to die. When the boat
was anchored, she refused to move or be
moved. The minister lifted her bodily, and
carried her to the dory. As he was handing
her over the side into the Captain&rsquo;s arms, she
objected to the transference by a sudden
lurch, which sent the minister to his knees.
His foot caught on the gunwale, and his
ankle was severely wrenched. On releasing
his shoe string that night he discovered a serious
sprain.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Lan&rsquo; sakes!&rdquo; exclaimed Miss Pipkin,
who, fully recovered, was busily engaged in
the kitchen on the following morning when
the minister entered. &ldquo;Now, what is the matter
with you, Mr. McGowan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was leaning on the back of a chair which
he was sliding along the floor in front of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I twisted my ankle last evening as I was
leaving the boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did! And you never said one word!
How did you do it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I slipped just as I handed you over the
side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was my foolishness that made you do
it. Josiah!&rdquo; she called, as the Captain came
down by the rear stair. &ldquo;Get me a basin of
water and the cayenne pepper, quick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Captain obeyed with alacrity. Miss
Pipkin soon had the ankle in the water, and
the water was a fiery red in color.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll take the swelling out,&rdquo; she affirmed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t you got it a mite too hot with pepper,
Clemmie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I ain&rsquo;t. That&rsquo;s all you men know
about such things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I didn&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The swelling began to disappear according
to the prophecy of the housekeeper, but the
skin took on the color of the reddened water
in the basin. An hour later Mr. McGowan
was undecided which was the more undesirable,
the pain from the sprain, or the blisters
from the treatment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cal&rsquo;late I&rsquo;ll run down to the <i>Jennie P.</i>,&rdquo;
announced the Captain after breakfast.
&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t navigate that far, can you,
Mack?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Josiah Pott! What on earth do you
mean? Of course he can&rsquo;t, and you know it.
I don&rsquo;t see what you want to go traipsing
down to that thing for, anyhow; it ain&rsquo;t going
to get loose, though it&rsquo;d be a good loss if it
did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t likely she&rsquo;ll get away, that&rsquo;s sartin
sure, but I thought I&rsquo;d do a little work on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
her. I ain&rsquo;t had much time afore now, with
all my cooking and keeping house. The minister
said my engine wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t clean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if you ain&rsquo;t been cooking better
than you&rsquo;ve been keeping house, the wonder
is you ain&rsquo;t both dead,&rdquo; she said, peering about
the room.</p>
<p>Fearing further comment, the Captain
hastily left the house. On reaching the wharf,
he was surprised to see Elizabeth walking
from the far end to meet him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Morning, Beth. Out purty early for
your constitutional, ain&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning, Uncle Josiah. I&rsquo;ve been
waiting for you an awful long time. Are you
going out to the <i>Jennie P.</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my calculation. Want to go
along?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I may.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you can. Did you leave something
aboard last night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. I just came down here on purpose
to see you. I felt certain you would be going
out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You come down just to see me? What do
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
you want to see an old feller like me for?
Now, if it was&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You, old! Who&rsquo;s been telling you that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody, &rsquo;cepting this infernal rheumatism.
But I ain&rsquo;t quite as badly crippled up
this morning as the preacher is, at that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean to say that the minister has
the rheumatism?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he ain&rsquo;t got nothing as tame or ordinary
as that. He started with a sprained
j&rsquo;int from the cruise, but he&rsquo;s going to have
something far worse, if I don&rsquo;t miss my guess.
Clemmie&rsquo;s been soaking his ankle in red pepper.&rdquo;
He chuckled quietly as he helped
Elizabeth into the dory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Soaking his foot in red pepper?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Hot as fire, too, it was. I asked if
she didn&rsquo;t have the water a mite too red, but
she said it wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t, and I cal&rsquo;late she&rsquo;d otter
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t she the quaintest little woman? I
remember her when I was a child, but she
didn&rsquo;t like me one bit because I spilled some
hot water on her once. Is she going to stay
with you?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s going to keep house,&rdquo; replied the
Captain, drawing the dory alongside his
power-boat. &ldquo;Well, here we be, Beth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elizabeth sprang lightly over the side. She
led the way to the roof of the cabin, where
she sat down. When the Captain had taken
his place at her side, she looked up eagerly
into his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do so hope you will understand me,
Uncle Josiah!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always tried to, Beth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know you have! Tell me, did my&ndash;&ndash;did
any one you know have anything to do with
making up that boxing match the other
night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was a good many that had to do
with it, unless I&rsquo;m &rsquo;way off in my reckoning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has Mr. McGowan said anything about
Father in connection with the affair?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He ain&rsquo;t said nothing to me,&rdquo; responded
the Captain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle Josiah!&rdquo; exclaimed the girl, her
eyes growing wide in her earnestness. &ldquo;I
know Father has not treated Mr. McGowan
one bit nicely since what happened at our
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
house, and I don&rsquo;t know why. There must be
some reason, though, for Father would not
harm any one without just reasons. He is
the best man in the whole world! But he has
had his way so long with all the other ministers
that he cannot become accustomed to the
way Mr. McGowan ignores him. Father
does a lot of good, and Mr. McGowan dare
not think ill of him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, there, Beth,&rdquo; soothed the Captain.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re trying to tell me something, but
you&rsquo;re getting off the course. Just you tell
me calm-like what it&rsquo;s all about. The fust
thing to do is to get our bearings. Has some
one been telling you that Mr. McGowan
thinks and talks about your dad in the way
you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No-o. But I&rsquo;ve heard others say that Father
knew all about the plans for that fight
before it happened, and that he could have
stopped it had he wished to. It isn&rsquo;t true!
And if Mr. McGowan even thinks it&rsquo;s true he
isn&rsquo;t fair. He will misjudge Father if he has
the least idea that he would stoop to such a
frame-up.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I cal&rsquo;late he ain&rsquo;t misjudging your father
none, Beth. So far as disobeying orders goes,
it&rsquo;s because he knows what&rsquo;s best. He ain&rsquo;t
likely to go contrary, unless&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I know he does misjudge Father,&rdquo;
broke in the girl in an attempt to return to
her former subject. &ldquo;And Father feels it
keenly. If he doesn&rsquo;t misjudge him, why
doesn&rsquo;t he come to our house any more to ask
advice about parish matters? He just goes
ahead to suit himself. Do you think that
fair?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Pott wanted to say no, in order to
agree with his young friend, but her big blue
eyes were too intent with eagerness to permit
of anything but the truth, or to hedge. He
chose the easiest way and hedged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t in no position to answer that,
Beth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I can&rsquo;t understand it at all! Why
can&rsquo;t they be friends as they were at first?
What has happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t answer that, neither.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just because Father has refused to
bow to him in some little matter, I suppose.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
Isn&rsquo;t there some way to get them together or
at least to get them to compromise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m &rsquo;feared it ain&rsquo;t in neither of &rsquo;em to do
either one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose not,&rdquo; she replied, a little catch
in her voice. &ldquo;But it is too bad to have the
work go to pieces like it is just because they
are both so stubborn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sartin is, Beth.&rdquo; The seaman fidgeted.
What could the girl be driving at?</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m in sympathy with my father!&rdquo;
she cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right for you, Beth. I&rsquo;d think less
of you if you felt any other way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only Mr. McGowan would go to
him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see if I get the hull drift of your
argument. You say that you think your father
is right, and the minister is wrong. That
being your conviction you think the minister
otter go to him and do a little apologizing.
Well, he won&rsquo;t. What he&rsquo;s done is just as
right to him as what your father thinks he&rsquo;d
otter done is right to your dad. To try to get
&rsquo;em together would be like trying to mix &rsquo;ile
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
and water, both of &rsquo;em good enough in their
place, but when you try to mix &rsquo;em what you
get ain&rsquo;t one nor t&rsquo;other, and sp&rsquo;iles both.
Cal&rsquo;late we&rsquo;d best leave &rsquo;em as they are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean that Mr. McGowan should
go to Father and apologize. That would be
too much like all of the others before him.
But I did think you might suggest some other
way to bring them together before things get
worse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beth, I&rsquo;d like to accommodate you, if
that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re asking of me, but if Mack
McGowan had chosen any other way than the
one he took, I&rsquo;d cut him adrift, sartin as
death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The seaman felt the girl at his side stiffen
and tremble against his arm as she turned
from him. Despair seized him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forgive me, Beth, for making you cry
like that. I ain&rsquo;t nothing but a rough old
sailor, and can&rsquo;t say things as they&rsquo;d otter be
said. Come, it ain&rsquo;t wuth crying over. What
I meant was that I&rsquo;d have disowned him, because
I&rsquo;d have known he was going contrary-wise
to what he thought was right.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span></div>
<p>She trembled more violently than before.
Too miserable for words, he seized her and
turned her about. He was amazed to find no
tears in her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t crying,&rdquo; she choked, drawing the
corner of her handkerchief from her mouth.
&ldquo;It struck me so funny, Uncle Josiah!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your notion of fun is the funniest I ever
see,&rdquo; he commented. &ldquo;Mind telling me what
it was that tickled you so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You! Captain Josiah Pott! Threatening
to disown the minister should he fail to
toe your chalk-line! Where, may I ask, can
one find a more high-handed tyranny of
spurned authority than that? It&rsquo;s too funny
for words!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cal&rsquo;late you&rsquo;d do some disowning, too, if
he&rsquo;d go traipsing round asking everybody&rsquo;s
pardon just because he steps on a few toes
now and again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I disown him?&rdquo; she asked, not able to
check the rush of color to her cheeks. &ldquo;Pray
tell! Why&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Now, see here, Beth, there ain&rsquo;t no use of
your pretending to me. I&rsquo;ve got a pair of
eyes, and I make use of &rsquo;em. You wouldn&rsquo;t
want him a mite different, and if he was, you&rsquo;d
be as disapp&rsquo;inted as me. I know what I&rsquo;m
talking about,&rdquo; he declared, holding up his
pipe with a convincing gesture. &ldquo;All that
he&rsquo;s done is as religious to him as preaching a
sermon, even that fight down to the Inn. It
was a heap sight more religious than a lot of
sermons I&rsquo;ve listened to in my day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Uncle Josiah, don&rsquo;t you think his
methods are a little too strenuous and out of
the ordinary in dealing with spiritual derelicts?&rdquo;
she asked, trying hard to hide the pride
which the Captain&rsquo;s observation had wakened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t got much of an idea what you
mean by spiritual derricks, Beth, but I&rsquo;m going
to say this: he&rsquo;s the fust real live preacher
I ever see, and if he&rsquo;s got ways of bringing
&rsquo;em in that&rsquo;s a mite off the set course, he&rsquo;s going
to do it, and there ain&rsquo;t enough men living
to stop him. He has found some of that queer
sort of religion what he called anonymous
down there to that Inn, and if he&rsquo;d have taken
water the other night he&rsquo;d have lost every one
of them boys. He fought that puncher because
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
he was after the gang behind him. If
things had gone against him, I&rsquo;d have pitched
in and helped him trounce the hull enduring
lot, and I&rsquo;d have felt mighty religious while I
was doing it, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I think he might prove just as much
a success and still not be so original. It
doesn&rsquo;t pay when one&rsquo;s position and salary depend
on how one acts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mack&rsquo;s position and salary can hang from
the same gallows, so far as he&rsquo;s concerned, if
they go to putting muzzles on him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad you said that!&rdquo; exclaimed the
girl, giving his arm a gentle squeeze.</p>
<p>The seaman stared at her. What on earth
could she mean? &ldquo;Beth, you&rsquo;ve sartin got
me gasping to understand you this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m trying so hard to explain without
actually telling you. He must leave the
church!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must leave&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;Say, what in tarnation
do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please, don&rsquo;t hint that I told you, but it
has been decided by the vestry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to know!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t to be on account of the fight,
though. Oh, I was real bad and listened,&rdquo;
she explained to the surprised seaman. &ldquo;I
didn&rsquo;t mean to at first, but I couldn&rsquo;t help
hearing. Then, I had to listen to the rest. I
shall tell Father what I have done just as soon
as I can, for I know it was wicked of me. I
felt I must come to you. They are going to
find something in his sermons that isn&rsquo;t orthodox,
and then, there is to be a church trial!
That was what I didn&rsquo;t want to tell you for
fear you wouldn&rsquo;t understand, but you didn&rsquo;t
suggest anything for me to do, and I had to
tell you. Can&rsquo;t you get Mr. McGowan to be
careful what he puts in his sermons?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am I to tell him whose orders they be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, not!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A heap of good it will do, then, for me to
say anything. He&rsquo;d take it as a banter for a
fight. Cal&rsquo;late we&rsquo;ll have to trust to luck that
he&rsquo;ll stick to the old chart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elizabeth slid from the roof of the cabin
to the deck. She walked to the railing and
looked over into the water. The Captain,
thinking she was ready to go ashore, followed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
She swung about, and stamped her foot,
angrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you men know how to act!
Why doesn&rsquo;t he know how to behave himself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned back and looked out across the
Sound. The mainland showed dim through
the haze of the Indian Summer morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beth, I hate to see you worrying like
this,&rdquo; said the Captain, a tremor in his voice.
&ldquo;I wish I could help you, I sartin wish I
could.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She came to him, and laying her hand
lightly on his sleeve, looked eagerly into his
eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You dear old Uncle! Please, forgive me
for telling you all I have. I am worried,
dreadfully worried, about Father. He is so
different of late. He takes everything so
seriously where Mr. McGowan is concerned.
He is not at all like himself. I&rsquo;m afraid something
dreadful will happen to him if things do
not right themselves very soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, don&rsquo;t you worry, Beth. Just you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
be patient. I cal&rsquo;late there is something
wrong, but there ain&rsquo;t no channel so long that
it ain&rsquo;t got an outlet of some sort, and the
rougher &rsquo;tis, the shorter it&rsquo;s li&rsquo;ble to be.
We&rsquo;re going to get out, you bank on that, and
when we do, your daddy is going to be
aboard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Uncle Josiah. I&rsquo;m ready
now to go ashore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The look of relief on her beautiful face, as
the tears of gratitude filled her eyes, caused
the Captain to swallow very hard, and to draw
the back of his hand across his eyes, remarking
that the smoke was getting into them. He
was unmindful that his pipe had gone out
long ago.</p>
<p>On his way home the skipper became uncomfortably
aware of the seriousness of his
promise to the Elder&rsquo;s daughter. He had
pledged himself and his support indirectly to
Jim Fox! What that might mean he could
not foresee. He remembered what Elizabeth
had told him concerning her father&rsquo;s condition,
and this set a new train of thought going
through his brain. He recalled that there
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
had always been times since Jim Fox had first
come to Little River when he had seemed dejected
and melancholy. Could it be possible
that there had been some physical disease
working all these years in the Elder&rsquo;s body,
and might that not be an explanation for the
mental state into which he seemed to be heading?
Might that not be the reason for his
strange actions against the minister and himself?</p>
<p>Captain Pott entered the dining-room just
as Miss Pipkin emerged from the minister&rsquo;s
study. She was carrying a large crock. The
seaman looked intently at the bowl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was a mite too much pepper in that
basin, Josiah. I was that excited about his
ankle that I didn&rsquo;t notice how much I was
putting in. It&rsquo;ll soon be better, now, for I
was bathing it in this cream that Mrs. Beaver
give me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bathing his foot in&ndash;&ndash;what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cream. It takes the soreness out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clemmie, you&rsquo;re a wonder! But if that
cream come from Eadie&rsquo;s I cal&rsquo;late it won&rsquo;t
be none too healing.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been talking to the minister about
the services,&rdquo; she said, placing the crock on
the table. &ldquo;The Ladies&rsquo; Aid meets this afternoon.
I&rsquo;m going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d best get a life-preserver on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Josiah, you shouldn&rsquo;t talk like that.
They do a lot of good. I ain&rsquo;t been to one for
years. It&rsquo;s so Christian and nice to do things
for others. That&rsquo;s what Aid means, aiding
some one else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I ain&rsquo;t &rsquo;way off, most of the aiding business
runs to the tongues of them present.
Most women lean to tongue, excepting you,
Clemmie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Josiah, you ain&rsquo;t fit for the minister to
live with! You shouldn&rsquo;t talk like that about
the business of the Lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cal&rsquo;late I am sort of a heathen. But I&rsquo;ll
wager that you&rsquo;ll find them there aiders interested
in some things aside the business of the
Lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Pipkin left him and hurried into the
kitchen for broom and duster.</p>
<p>It was late in the afternoon when she had
finished her house-cleaning, and sailed forth
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
in the direction of the church. The Captain
was sitting on the front steps of the chapel,
and rose to meet her as she turned in at the
gate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope the meeting ain&rsquo;t over,&rdquo; she said,
breathless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just got her off the ways, I&rsquo;d say,&rdquo; he
commented, jerking his head toward an open
window through which came the sound of
many voices. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d best tell &rsquo;em where
you&rsquo;re staying, Clemmie, or you&rsquo;re li&rsquo;ble to
hear some things not intended for your ears.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She bridled past him and swept into the
church. There was a brief pause in the buzz,
but the hubbub that followed was doubled in
intensity.</p>
<p>That evening while Miss Pipkin was placing
the food on the table she appeared worried.
She inquired solicitously concerning the
minister&rsquo;s ankle, but there was a distant polite
tone in her voice. After supper she asked the
Captain to dry the dishes for her, and went to
the kitchen. The seaman took his place at the
sink only to have the cloth snatched from his
hand.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Josiah,&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;she whispered,&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;close that
door to the dining-room, I&rsquo;ve got something
to ask you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t you going to let me dry them dishes
for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The door was closed, and the Captain came
back to the sink.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong with Mr. McGowan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too much red pepper, I cal&rsquo;late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be silly. You know what I mean.
There is something awfully wrong. I can&rsquo;t
help noticing it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What makes you think that, Clemmie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I heard this afternoon.... And,
you know, the most of &rsquo;em knew me, but
none excepting Mrs. Beaver knew where I
was staying, and she didn&rsquo;t tell. She come
over and set down by me, different from what
she used to be, quiet and real refined.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eadie Beaver quiet, you say? Well, I
cal&rsquo;late the million is coming, sartin sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Millennium or no millennium, that&rsquo;s the
truth. I was kind of &rsquo;feared at first that she
wasn&rsquo;t real well.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;d be a real cur&rsquo;osity in this here new
state of hers,&rdquo; mused the Captain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I begun to hear things about him,&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;she
pointed toward the closed door,&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;and
Mrs. Beaver was that indignant that she
didn&rsquo;t know what to do. From all I heard, it
seems the minister has been doing things he
has no right to do, fighting and the like.
Then, too,&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;came in an awed tone,&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;he
ain&rsquo;t orthodox. He&rsquo;s preaching all sorts of
new-fangled ideas that he shouldn&rsquo;t mention
in the pulpit, and though you don&rsquo;t know it,
Josiah, that is hairsay! That is worse than
killing a man, because it sends their souls to
hell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I was you, Clemmie, I&rsquo;d wait and
judge his preaching for myself. You ain&rsquo;t
heard him yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Pipkin agreed to the fairness of the
Captain&rsquo;s proposition, but she was still troubled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Josiah, there&rsquo;s going to be some sort of
meeting next Sunday night after the regular
service, and there is going to be something
done to get Mr. McGowan out of his church.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
Of course, if he ain&rsquo;t orthodox, I&rsquo;d hate to see
the meeting interfered with, but&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clemmie, I ain&rsquo;t up on this hairsay and
orthodox stuff, and I ain&rsquo;t sartin I want to be.
It all sounds like mighty dry picking to me.
But I&rsquo;ve been thinking, and I&rsquo;ve decided that
whatever them things are they ain&rsquo;t real religion.
And I&rsquo;ve decided that the Lord ain&rsquo;t
been sitting in on them church meetings for
quite a spell. I cal&rsquo;late I&rsquo;ll be on hand next
Sunday night with a special invitation for
Him to cut the pack for this new deal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Pipkin looked as though she expected
him to be struck dead. But he was not. This
fact decided her in favor of being present to
witness the thing which the Captain intended
to do.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
</div>
<p>On Sunday evening the chapel was packed.
It was evident that many were there, not for
the service, but for what promised to be a sensational
after-meeting. Members of the Athletic
Club were scattered through the room,
and the same dogged determination was on
their faces as on the night of the boxing
affair.</p>
<p>Mr. McGowan hobbled up the pulpit stair.
He announced his text: &ldquo;Launch out into the
deep and let down your nets.&rdquo; Captain Pott
felt Elizabeth, who was sitting beside him,
stiffen. Miss Pipkin leaned forward in her
eagerness to catch every word, and as the minister
proceeded her expression changed from
perplexity and doubt to one of deep respect.
There were others who followed the thought
of the sermon with keen interest. Elder Fox
was present, for the first time in weeks. Occasionally,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
he would write something on a pad,
and then lean back to pull at his silky chops.</p>
<p>Throughout the sermon Mr. McGowan
spoke with tense earnestness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The time has come when the church must
cut the <a name='TC_6'></a><ins class="tnchg" title="&#34;spelling standardized&#34;">shore lines</ins> that have been binding us
to the past. If a man persists in dragging
the shore line he may get a few good fish, but
that does not set aside the fact that he is either
a poor fisherman or a coward. He must
know the habits of the fish, and go where they
are.... The same thing may be said of
the church. We may produce a few fair
Christians by dragging shore lines of church
doctrine, but our success will be due more to
luck than to a knowledge of the working of
God&rsquo;s laws.... We have been long-shore
Christians for a good many centuries;
the day has come for us to break away from
the surf of man-made ideas, and launch out
till we can feel the swell of a boundless love, a
love not confined to the letter of denominational
law or creed. We must get into us the
spirit of Christianity. We must recognize
the fact that the spirit is not a thing that we
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
can confine to sand-lined beaches of narrow
conceptions of faith and salvation that now
exist in our churches....</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here in Little River we have been an excellent
example of what I mean. We have
been admiring ourselves,&ndash;&ndash;and not without
just cause,&ndash;&ndash;while the world we ought to be
serving is forced to take its stand on the outside,
ofttimes with ideals greater than our
own.... We have substituted doctrine
for Christianity, the letter of the law for the
spirit of freedom. We have slavishly worshipped
our beliefs about God, instead of worshipping
God.... And what is the result?
We have shut our doors to many who
hold a greater faith than our own; or we
have forced them out with no faith because
of our own selfish religious intoxication.
Of this very thing, this church has been
guilty....</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must admit blame for many conditions
that exist in our town. Let us purge
ourselves before we seek to cleanse others.
Let us first launch out before we call to others
to follow. Let us learn the laws by which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
God works, and then shall we have no trouble
to fill our nets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After Mr. McGowan had finished, he stood
looking out over his congregation. The Captain
whispered to Elizabeth, &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t he the
finest-looking specimen of human natur&rsquo; you
ever see, six foot of him standing up there
reading the riot act to &rsquo;em! And I got all he
said, too. I cal&rsquo;late there&rsquo;s some here to-night
that feel like they&rsquo;d been overhauled and set
adrift.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without announcing the usual closing
hymn, Mr. McGowan very quietly pronounced
the benediction, and left the church
by the rear door.</p>
<p>The only move that followed his leaving
was made by the members of the Athletic
Club. They filed out one by one, but reconvened
beneath the window where the Captain
sat inside. Captain Pott was plainly nervous
when Mr. Fox rose and went forward. He
opened the window slightly as though in need
of fresh air.</p>
<p>The Elder clapped loudly for order, and
the boys beneath the Captain&rsquo;s window joined
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
in so heartily that the Elder was forced to
shout for order.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This meeting has been called for the members
of this church, <i>only</i>!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Will
those who are not members in regular standing
adjourn to the rooms below to complete
their visiting?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Few heard, none obeyed. Instead, all began
to take seats as near the front as possible.
Mr. Fox grew red in the face, and dark of
countenance. But he preserved his dignity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must I repeat that this meeting has been
called for the members of the church. Will
the others kindly leave us to ourselves?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It became evident that there was no intention
on the part of any to leave the room, and
so the Elder called the mixed crowd to order.</p>
<p>The first half-hour proved so tame that
some who had remained to see trouble, got up
and went home. At last Mr. Beaver rose,
and the audience caught its breath. He
poised himself on one foot, and began to
pump, blink, whistle, and finally to stutter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;M-M-Mr. Ch-ch-ch-chairman!&rdquo; he called
in a high excited voice.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span></div>
<p>Elder Fox declared that Mr. Beaver had
the floor, and Mr. Beaver proceeded to take it,
at least a good part of the section round which
he was hopping. People moved back and
gave him room, for he needed plenty of space
in which to make himself understood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The p-p-parish c-committee h-h-has d-decided
that M-Mr. McGowan is not the m-m-man
for our ch-ch-church. Elder F-F-Fox
has the report of the c-c-committee. I
m-m-move we h-h-h-hear him now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Fox mounted the platform and came
forward to the edge. He looked into the
faces of those before him with deep sadness in
his own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Friends, this is one of the saddest moments
of my life,&rdquo; he began, his voice shaking
with feeling. &ldquo;Some&ndash;&ndash;er&ndash;&ndash;have come to love
our young brother who has been called to our
church. And he has many very estimable
qualities. For that reason I feel very keenly
what I am about to say. The committee feels
that Mr. McGowan holds ideas that are too
far advanced for our humble little church.
We must not overlook the fact that we hold
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
sacred some of the things to which he flippantly
referred to-night, and it is our duty to
protect&ndash;&ndash;er&ndash;&ndash;the sacred doctrines which have
been handed down to us from the more sacred
memory of our fathers and martyrs of the
past.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our minister does not believe in the divine
inspiration of the Bible. The question was
put to him by one of the members of this committee,
and he replied&ndash;&ndash;er&ndash;&ndash;that even if every
jot and tittle were personally dictated by God&ndash;&ndash;which
he doubted&ndash;&ndash;the Bible would remain
a sealed book unless it inspired those who read
it. It is evident from this answer that he does
not believe in&ndash;&ndash;er&ndash;&ndash;our sacred doctrine of the
verbal inspiration of Scripture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have heard him to-night, asking us&ndash;&ndash;er&ndash;&ndash;in
the common slang of the dock to rid
ourselves of all these doctrines on which the
church has been founded. What he said
proves that he does not believe in the fundamentals
of Christian faith.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I need not go back of this sermon so fresh
in our minds to prove to your intelligence that
Mr. McGowan is not orthodox. I could call
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
to your attention many unfortunate statements,
but I feel that it is not necessary.
Your committee has gone over every detail&ndash;&ndash;er&ndash;&ndash;prayerfully
and thoughtfully. Truly, it
gives me a pain&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get a bottle of Watkins&rsquo; Relief!&rdquo; piped
a shrill voice through the partially opened
window.</p>
<p>Taken by surprise, and with his mouth
open, the Elder lost every expression of dignity
as he gazed in the direction whence the
advice had come. Before he could again
gather up the threads of his closing remarks
several men were demanding the floor. The
Elder scanned the faces of all, in order to
place friend and foe. He then fixed his
glance on some one at the rear of the room.
In answer to the Elder&rsquo;s nod a heavy basso
pealed forth.</p>
<p>Every head turned about, and as the buzz
of comment broke from the astonished crowd
the Elder rapped for order. The Reverend
Mr. Means of New York City moved ponderously
forward.</p>
<p>The faces of the sympathetic ones in the audience
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
became exceedingly serious as each
looked into the face of the city clergyman.
Certainly, this meeting must be of tremendous
importance to lead so great a man to leave his
metropolitan pulpit to attend a gathering in
so small a church.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must have better order!&rdquo; cried Mr.
Fox, smiling a welcome to the visiting minister.
&ldquo;We have the unexpected pleasure of a
visit from&ndash;&ndash;er&ndash;&ndash;our much-loved friend and
brother. Shall we dispense with the business
of the hour and hear what the Reverend Mr.
Means may have on his heart?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Means took his position near the moderator.
With a long sympathetic look he
searched the invisible among the shadows of
the ceiling. He was calm, too calm, thought
the Captain. He drew his frock coat about
him, and plunged the fingers of his right hand
in between the two buttons over his heart.
That attitude, as of one weary with the struggles
of men and yet tolerant because of long-suffering
kindness, had an immediate effect on
part of the audience. From somewhere near
the center of the room applause started, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
soon swelled to a moderate ovation. He acknowledged
the respect shown him by bringing
his eyes down to the level of his audience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brethren,&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;his voice trembled as he began
to speak,&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;I have no special message
for you to-night; my heart is too sore from
the things I have just seen and heard. I have
been in the rear of this room during your entire
service. I have listened to the unfortunate
sermon which your bright young minister
was so unwise as to preach. I do not marvel
that you are like a flock of sheep having no
shepherd; that sermon was enough to confuse
even me, and I have been in the ministry a
great many years. I feel I must say something,
but I earnestly pray that it may not influence
you in this matter which is yours to
decide. I do not intend to even suggest what
action you ought to take on the report of your
parish committee. You must remember that
what you do to-night may affect the future of
our young brother, and you must not wreck
that future. Mr. McGowan and I do not
agree on matters of theology, but that fact
does not prevent me from admiring some of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
his fine qualities to which your senior Elder
referred to-night. Time may cool the ardor
of his youth into sane and safe ideas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;he lifted his hands toward
heaven and his voice toward the people,&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;what
your parish committee chairman has
told you in his report is true, only too true.
We cannot afford to permit our churches to
suffer from such teachings as those given you
to-night, and I dare say, which have been
given you many times past. Brethren, as
great as is our love for this young minister, it
is as nothing in comparison with the devotion
that should be ours where the doctrines of our
church are concerned. I opposed the ordination
of Mr. McGowan in the New York Presbytery
a year ago on the ground that he was
not sound in doctrine, but when my brethren
passed him over my protest I acquiesced as a
Christian must always do when the voice of
the majority speaks. But I must say that I
greatly deplored the action taken at that time.
Not that I hold any personal feelings against
the young man, but because I am opposed to
unorthodox men being called to our pulpits.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Now, brethren, I should gladly waive all
this,&rdquo; he continued, dropping his voice to a
soothing whisper, &ldquo;but theological differences
are not all that stand between the young man
and a faithful church. You&rsquo;ve heard him
suggest that the church which should be the
house of God, and which Scripture calls the
house of prayer, be turned into a playhouse
for the community. I cannot imagine any
man with a passion to save souls holding to an
idea that he can accomplish this by desecrating
the place of Divine Worship by turning
it into a gymnasium. The only explanation
possible is that Mr. McGowan has not been
reared under the influences of our best families.
Not that this is anything against his
character, but fact is fact.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The room became quiet with interest in anticipation
of what might follow. It was true
that their minister had come to them as an unknown
man, and they were certainly entitled to
any disclosure of his past that the city man
might wish to give. But there was nothing
more said on the subject, and a murmur of disapproval
ran over the audience.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I have finished, except to say that I honor
your Elder for the firm stand he has taken.
Mr. Fox, you are to be congratulated on
your courage, and although I repeat that I
would not think of influencing the action of
this assembly, I hope that every man
and woman present may see fit to support
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Pott had grown more and more
restless as time went on, and now as the city
minister began to move from the platform the
Captain began to move toward the open window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am ready to entertain any motion which
you care to make,&rdquo; announced the chairman.</p>
<p>Mr. Beaver rose. With the first hiss from
his lips, the Captain dropped his hand over the
sill and tapped the outside of the casing.
Shouts went up from the boys who stood beneath
the window. These were answered by
cries of fire from various parts of town. The
clang of the gong at the fire-house broke
through the stillness of the crowded room.
Distant alarms were rung with steady
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
regularity. The meeting adjourned in a
body.</p>
<p>The seaman had kept his promise, and
&ldquo;Providence had cut the pack for the new
deal.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
</div>
<p>In an incredibly short time the church was
emptied. Each one in the crowd was shouting
wild conjectures as to whose place was on
fire as they ran in the direction of the blaze.
It was a strange sight that met the gaze of the
excited people as they came in full view of
Dan Trelaw&rsquo;s place. He was busily engaged
pouring oil on unburned sections of his hen-coops!
Dan&rsquo;s hen-houses were located at the
rear of his property, and had been built from
a collection of dry-goods boxes. They had
been the pride of his life, and as the crowd
watched him pour on more oil, some one declared
that Dan must have gone out of his
senses. Nor would he permit the fire company
to play their chemical hose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s come to a purty pass,&rdquo; Dan stated to
the onlookers, &ldquo;when a man can&rsquo;t burn down
his own coops to get rid of the mites without
the whole blame town turning out to interfere.
If the very last one of you don&rsquo;t clear out, I&rsquo;ll
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
use my office as constable of this town to run
the lot of you in!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hank Simpson was the chief of the volunteer
corps, and Dan was chief of the Little
River police system. The two chiefs argued
as to the rights of the respective offices.
Hank declared it was his official duty to put
the fire out. Dan as emphatically declared it
was his official duty to disperse the crowd.
Finally, Hank admitted that Dan had a right
to burn his own property so long as the property
of others was not endangered. Some say
that the chief of police answered the chief of
the fire corps with a slow and deliberate
wink.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, all of you clear out and leave me to
my fire,&rdquo; demanded Dan, as he poured on
more oil.</p>
<p>Mr. McGowan had gone directly home
after the preaching service. But he did not
sleep that night. It was very early on Monday
morning when he entered the kitchen.
Miss Pipkin was already busy with the preparations
for breakfast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning, Mr. McGowan,&rdquo; greeted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
Miss Pipkin, cheerily. &ldquo;Are you all right
this morning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, thank you, Miss Pipkin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was afraid you&rsquo;d be sick after last night.
I didn&rsquo;t sleep none, I was that excited when I
got home. I&rsquo;ve always been used to quiet
meetings, and that last night after you left
was a disgrace. But you wasn&rsquo;t to blame, no
siree!&rdquo; she finished with a vigorous shake of
her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not so sure that you would find very
many to agree with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lan&rsquo; sakes! How you do talk, Mr. McGowan!
Don&rsquo;t you think I know what it&rsquo;s
all about? I ain&rsquo;t blind, and what I couldn&rsquo;t
see through, Josiah helped me with last night.
You&rsquo;ve got him to thank that they didn&rsquo;t vote
you out of your position.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Pipkin, do you mean that the Captain
spoke up in meeting?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he didn&rsquo;t exactly talk, but he
stopped others from talking, and that&rsquo;s about
the same thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; asked the minister eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He kind of made me promise not to tell a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
soul, but I don&rsquo;t think he meant you. Anyhow,
you should know. You see, he was setting
by a window, and some of the boys from
your club was on the outside, waiting. He
h&rsquo;isted the window a little so&rsquo;s to get his hand
through. Hank Simpson and some others
was at the fire-house, and when Josiah give
them beneath the window some sort of signal,
they all shouted &lsquo;<i>Fire</i>.&rsquo; That was the sign for
others scattered round town, and they begun
to shout, too. Then, those at the fire-house
got the cart out and rung the bells. It was
real funny, but don&rsquo;t tell Josiah I said so, because
he was all puffed up last night. He
gave his signal just as Mr. Beaver got up to
make a motion to have you put out. Things
was pretty strong against you after Reverend
Mr. Means spoke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Means!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Um-hm. He was there as big as life and
sad as Job. He talked so tearful-like that
everybody was upset, but they didn&rsquo;t get to
take a vote, and that was a good thing, for
there were some there that would have voted
against you, being so worked up, who
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
wouldn&rsquo;t think of it in their right senses. Mr.
McGowan, them boys down to the Inn ain&rsquo;t
going to let you go from the town if they can
keep you here. Them boys with Josiah got
up that fire scare last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it was more than a scare, I saw the
fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Course you did. &rsquo;Twas old Dan Trelaw&rsquo;s
hen-house that was burned down. The
mites was bothering him, and he wanted the
insurance to build a better one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He burned his hen-house to collect insurance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what Josiah said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s absurd. There isn&rsquo;t an insurance
company in Suffolk County that would write
a policy on such junk, and if they did he could
never collect a cent if it is known he burned it
on purpose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Josiah said it wasn&rsquo;t a regular company,
just local. I guess he&rsquo;ll get his money, all
right. Are you ready for your breakfast?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A boyish grin slowly lighted the minister&rsquo;s
face as the truth of what had happened
dawned on him.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t saying right out just what I
mean,&rdquo; she broke in as she paused on the
kitchen threshold. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re real bright on
guessing, you&rsquo;ll be able to figure that out for
yourself. The thing that&rsquo;s most interesting
to me is that the Lord is wonderful in the performing
of all His works, and we ain&rsquo;t to
question how He brings &rsquo;em to pass. I wasn&rsquo;t
much in favor of the way Josiah done last
night when he first told me, but the more I
think about it, the more it seems all right to
me. It didn&rsquo;t seem dignified and nice to
break up even a bad meeting that way, but
what else was he to do? You&rsquo;ve got to stay
here, that&rsquo;s plain, and if He ain&rsquo;t got saints
enough to keep you He&rsquo;ll use the heathen....
Go right in and set down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure that it will bring Providence
or any one else much glory if I stay here,&rdquo; said
the minister, with a faint smile.</p>
<p>Miss Pipkin returned with a steaming pot
of coffee. She took her place at the table and
for some time eyed the minister in silence.
She was a thoroughgoing mystic in her religious
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
faith, but her mysticism was tempered
with such a practical turn of mind that it was
wholesome and inspiring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. McGowan, it is the will of God that
you stay right here in this town. If we do
His will we ain&rsquo;t to worry about the glory
part,&rdquo; she emphatically affirmed. She placed
the cups and saucers beside the coffee-pot and
filled them. &ldquo;You hit &rsquo;em hard last night,
and that is exactly what&rsquo;s ailing them. You&rsquo;ve
been hitting &rsquo;em too hard for comfort. The
shoe&rsquo;s pinching and they&rsquo;re not able to keep
from showing how it hurts. You hit me, too,&rdquo;
she observed, looking earnestly into the minister&rsquo;s
eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t be, &rsquo;cause it wasn&rsquo;t you
speaking. It was God speaking through you.
Them words you used for your text rung in
my ears all night long. I could hear &rsquo;em
plainer than when you spoke &rsquo;em from the
pulpit: &lsquo;Launch out into the deep.&rsquo; Mr. McGowan,
do you believe there is any forgiveness
for the unpardonable sin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Evidently knowing that a minister of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
Presbyterian faith could entertain but one answer
and remain a moral man, she did not wait
for a reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was years ago when I first heard them
words. They were just as plain to me then as
they was last night, but I refused to obey &rsquo;em.
I didn&rsquo;t think I could stand the ocean. You
know the way I was coming over from Riverhead.
Well, I&rsquo;m always sick on the water,
and so I said right out that I wouldn&rsquo;t set sail
as a seaman&rsquo;s wife. I was young and strong-headed
then, and didn&rsquo;t understand. The
man I said &lsquo;No&rsquo; to went off, and I never
heard from him but three times since. Some
said he was drowned at sea, but I know he
wasn&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;ve been true to him all these years,
trying to atone for my sin of disobedience. If
he&rsquo;d come back now, I&rsquo;d go with him though
he&rsquo;d slay me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. McGowan wanted to smile at the
mixed figure, but the serious face before him
prevented him. &ldquo;Did you say you never
heard from him?&rdquo; he asked, sympathetically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. I didn&rsquo;t say that.&rdquo; She spoke
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
sharply, but immediately her face and tone
softened. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to speak cross, but
I ain&rsquo;t spoke of this for years, and it upsets
me when I think of what I done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll not speak of it, then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t disturb me the least bit. It sort
of helps to talk about it. I&rsquo;m thinking all the
time about him, how brave he was. He was
so manly, too, was my Adoniah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Adoniah?&rdquo; questioned the minister, sitting
up with a suddenness that astonished
Miss Pipkin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Adoniah was his first name. I ain&rsquo;t spoke
it out loud for years. It does sound sort of
queer, doesn&rsquo;t it? I didn&rsquo;t think so then.&rdquo;
She sighed deeply. &ldquo;The spirit of the Lord
seemed to go away from me when Adoniah
did. If only he&rsquo;d come back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has not left you. God is not a hard
master, leaving people alone for their shortcomings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think He&rsquo;ll send him back to
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is here now. He has never left you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Pipkin looked dazed, then puzzled,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
and finally provoked. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;d
trifle, or I&rsquo;d never told you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, I&rsquo;m not trifling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, what happened last night has gone
to your head, poor thing! I&rsquo;d ought to have
known better than to have troubled you with
my sorrows. You&rsquo;ve got all you ought to
carry. Poor thing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She slowly pushed her chair from the table,
eyeing the minister as though expecting
signs of an outbreak. But he motioned her
back into her chair with a calmness that reassured
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t quite understand your meaning,
I guess,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it is quite apparent that I didn&rsquo;t understand
yours. You were speaking of the
Spirit of God leaving you, and I said He was
right here with you&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, ain&rsquo;t I a caution to saints!&rdquo; broke
in Miss Pipkin. &ldquo;I did mix you up awful,
didn&rsquo;t I? What I was asking you about was
if you thought God would send back my
Adoniah Phillips. He&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;Why, Mr. McGowan,
what&rsquo;s the matter now?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span></div>
<p>The minister had risen and was looking
oddly at the housekeeper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What on earth have I said this time?&rdquo;
she implored.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You say your lover&rsquo;s name was Phillips,
Adoniah Phillips?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Pipkin did not reply, but looked at
him fixedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please, don&rsquo;t look at me like that, it
makes me feel like I&rsquo;ve been guilty of something,&rdquo;
he said, trying hard to smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You sure you ain&rsquo;t sick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, I&rsquo;m not ill. I&rsquo;m slightly interested
in that peculiar name. I&rsquo;ve heard it
just once before, and I&rsquo;m wondering if there
is a chance of its being the same man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve heard of him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I have heard his name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t likely to be another name like
his.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you any idea where he is at present?
You said a bit ago that you did not
think he had been drowned at sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she answered curtly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you so much as guess?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if he&rsquo;s living at all, so of
course I ain&rsquo;t got no idea where he is,&rdquo; was
her snappy reply. &ldquo;Has he been telling you
about me and him?&rdquo; she asked, nodding toward
the up-stairs where the Captain was
presumably asleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t said anything to me, but&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll promise not to repeat one word to
him of what I just told you?&rdquo; she begged,
again jerking her head toward the stair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I promise to say nothing about what you
have told me. But I have my reasons for
wanting to know something about this man
Phillips.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are your reasons?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should not have said reasons, for I guess
it is nothing but my curiosity that prompts
me to ask. If you could tell me more of the
facts I might be able to help you locate him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean you have an idea that he is
still living?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say as to that, but if you&rsquo;ll only
help me I am certain that we shall find out
something interesting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Pipkin drew the corner of her apron
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
across the corner of her eyes, disappointment
written deeply in every line and wrinkle of
her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t much more to tell. Adoniah
went to sea. I got a letter from him once
from Australia. I wrote back saying I&rsquo;d take
back what I&rsquo;d said. He answered it, but
didn&rsquo;t say nothing about what I said to him.
He spoke of meeting up with some one he
knew, saying they was going in business together.
I ain&rsquo;t never told anybody about
that, not even Josiah, and I ain&rsquo;t going to
tell you, for I don&rsquo;t think he was square with
Adoniah, but I can&rsquo;t prove it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The thud of heavy boots on the rear stair
checked further comment she seemed inclined
to make, and she dried out the tears that stood
in her eyes with short quick dabs as she hurried
to the kitchen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lan&rsquo; of mercy!&rdquo; she exclaimed, returning
with a smoking waffle-iron. &ldquo;I clean forgot
these, and they&rsquo;re burned to ashes. Here,
don&rsquo;t you drink that cold coffee, I&rsquo;ll heat it up
again,&rdquo; she said, taking the cup. Leaning
closely to his ear, she whispered, &ldquo;Mind, you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
ain&rsquo;t to tell a living soul about what I said,
and him above all others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The minister nodded.</p>
<p>Miss Pipkin entered the kitchen just as the
Captain opened the stair-door. He sniffed
the air as he greeted the two with a hearty
&ldquo;Good morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Purty nigh never woke up. You&rsquo;d
otter have come up and tumbled me out,
Mack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rest well, did you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just tolerable. Clemmie,&rdquo; he called, &ldquo;I
seem to smell something burning. There
ain&rsquo;t nothing, be there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We was busy talking, and them irons got
too hot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Talking, be you? Don&rsquo;t &rsquo;pear to have
agreed with neither of you more than it did
with those irons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t pass a mirror on the way
down this morning, or you&rsquo;d not be crowing
so loud, Josiah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s a fact I didn&rsquo;t. You see,
Eadie busted mine during that cleaning raid,
and I can&rsquo;t afford a new one.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;You must have hit your funny-bone, or
something,&rdquo; hinted Miss <a name='TC_7'></a><ins class="tnchg" title="Was &#34;Pipin&#34;">Pipkin</ins> as she poured
a cup of the reheated coffee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, don&rsquo;t get mad, Clemmie. I was
just fooling. Mack understands me purty
well, and he&rsquo;ll tell you that I didn&rsquo;t mean
nothing by what I said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Josiah Pott! You&rsquo;re that disrespectful
that I&rsquo;ve a good mind to scold you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up now, Clemmie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The very idea! You calling the minister
by his first name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done it ever since I knowed him, and
he wouldn&rsquo;t like me to change now. Hey,
Mr. McGowan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Call me by my first name, Cap&rsquo;n. Too
much dignity doesn&rsquo;t sit well on your shoulders.
You needn&rsquo;t mind, Miss Pipkin, for
that is a habit that was formed before I became
a minister, and there is no disrespect, I
assure you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean you two knowed each other before
you come here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, Mack come to me one summer
when I was starting on a cruise, and he was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
such a good sailor that we spent four seasons
together after that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You never told me that,&rdquo; said Miss Pipkin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think to, Clemmie. Mack, have
some more of these waffles. They&rsquo;re mighty
tasty. It takes Clemmie to cook &rsquo;em to a
turn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just listen to that!&rdquo; rejoined the housekeeper.
&ldquo;He ain&rsquo;t had none yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The minister did the unheard-of thing: he
refused the offer of waffles!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mack, you ain&rsquo;t going to let them hypocrites
and wolves in sheep&rsquo;s clothing come
right up and steal your appetite out of your
mouth, be you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. McGowan assured him that he had no
such intention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re missing,&rdquo;
declared the Captain, smacking his lips to
make the waffles appear more appetizing.
&ldquo;Have just one. Maybe your appetite is one
of them coming kind, and I&rsquo;ll swan if &rsquo;tis that
one taste of these would bring it with a gallop.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t urge him if he don&rsquo;t want &rsquo;em,
Josiah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cal&rsquo;late your talking must have gone to
his stomach, hey, Clemmie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Josiah!&rdquo; she exclaimed, coloring. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll
soon forget all I said to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You sartin give it to &rsquo;em good last night,
Mack. It was the best I ever heard. Got
most of &rsquo;em where they lived, and you took
&rsquo;em out into the deep beyond their wading-line,
too. How about you, Clemmie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Pipkin had important business in the
kitchen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mack, that sure was a ringer,&rdquo; continued
the Captain as he helped himself to
another layer of waffles. &ldquo;Wonder if Clemmie
took what you said about launching out
as literal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Pipkin returned with a plate of smoking
waffles and placed them at the Captain&rsquo;s
side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, Clemmie. I was &rsquo;feared you&rsquo;d
be setting out to sea in my dory after hearing
that sermon last night,&rdquo; he said banteringly,
with a twinkle in his eyes. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d best explain
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
that your meaning was figur&rsquo;tive, Mack.
I looked up that word once and it
means&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Josiah Pott! How can you be so
cruel!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a sob that rose from the depths, Miss
Pipkin fled, slamming the kitchen door after
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll swear, if she ain&rsquo;t crying!&rdquo; exclaimed
the surprised seaman. &ldquo;What in tarnation
do you suppose is up, Mack? You don&rsquo;t cal&rsquo;late
she thought I was relating to her for earnest,
do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He rose and started toward the door. Mr.
McGowan laid a hand on his friend&rsquo;s sleeve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better leave her alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I never meant nothing. She&rsquo;d otter
know that. I&rsquo;m going to tell her,&rdquo; he said,
pulling away from the minister, and trying
the closed door. &ldquo;Clemmie, be sensible, and
come out of there. I didn&rsquo;t mean nothing,
honest, I didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Miss Pipkin did not come out. She
did not so much as answer his importunings.
When the men were out of the dining-room
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
she went up-stairs, not to appear again that
day.</p>
<p>It was afternoon when Mr. McGowan hobbled
out of his study, ate a light lunch, put a
few sandwiches in his pocket, and started in
the direction of the peninsula road that led to
the beach.</p>
<hr class='toprule' />

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
</div>
<p>Mr. McGowan left the highway a little beyond
the Fox estate, and followed a crooked,
narrow old footpath across-lots. The path
dipped and rose with the contour of the land
till at last it lost itself in the white level
stretch of sandy beach. He walked on and
on, so deeply absorbed in his thoughts that he
was unmindful of the blistered foot. It was
only when hunger pains conspired with the irritation
of his foot that he dropped on a log.
He drew the sandwiches from his pocket, and
proceeded to devour them with genuine relish.
For hours after he had finished his lunch, he
sat with his back to the warming rays of the
afternoon sun, and gazed vacantly across the
wide stretches of sand-dunes.</p>
<p>The chill of the evening air roused him at
length to the fact that he must be going home.
But when he tried to rise, he discovered that
his long walk had produced an ill effect on
Miss Pipkin&rsquo;s remedy for sprained ankles.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
He dropped back again on the log, pondering
on how he was to retrace his steps. The sun
slipped into the misty haze that hung low
above the horizon of the autumn sky. The
shadows crept slowly up out of the waters and
over the landscape. A thin cloud drifted in
over the Sound, through which a pale moon
pushed a silvery edge. With the gathering
darkness there came a deep mystery over land
and sea which seemed to creep round and envelop
him.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the chill of the evening air was
filled with a glowing warmth, as when one
senses the presence of a friend. He stared
about him. He listened intently. Could it
be possible that this sudden change was only
a mental fancy? He hobbled a short way up
the beach, and as he rounded a promontory
his weakened ankle turned on a loose stone.
With an exclamation he settled down on the
sand.</p>
<p>A figure near the water&rsquo;s edge rose as
though startled. She paused, ready for
flight. Then with an involuntary cry came
toward the man huddled up on the sand.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;O dear, you are hurt!&rdquo; she cried, as he
attempted to rise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elizabeth!&rdquo; He spoke her name without
thought of what he did, even as she had unknowingly
used the word of endearment in
her exclamation of surprise and concern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should not have walked so far,&rdquo; she
said, her tone cordial, but her eyes holding a
smoldering fire. She helped him to a near-by
stone, and sat down beside him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I somehow felt that you were near.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You thought&ndash;&ndash;what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I did not think it, I just sensed it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You certainly have a very fertile imagination.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. It has been both my blessing and
curse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how did you come to feel I was about
here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. It does seem strange,
doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; he mused. &ldquo;But I was certain&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you were thinking&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; She
stopped abruptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of you,&rdquo; he finished for her. &ldquo;I was. I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span>
was feeling quite lonely, and couldn&rsquo;t help
wishing I could talk with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard to-day that you are thinking of
leaving Little River,&rdquo; she suggested, tactfully
changing what she considered a dangerous
subject.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You heard that I intend to leave? Pray,
tell&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;re not going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite to the contrary, I intend to fight
this thing through if it takes a whole year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad!&rdquo; There was deep relief in
her voice. She hesitated before continuing.
&ldquo;I had a terrible quarrel with Father this
evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did you do that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was very angry, and left him to come
out here. It is the first time we have ever
really fallen out. I&rsquo;ve thought over some of
the unkind things I said to him, and I am
ashamed. I was about to go back to him when
you fell on those stones and hurt yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right, Miss Fox. Go back to
him. He will see differently, too, now that he
has had time to think it all over.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;That is what worries me. He won&rsquo;t see
differently, though I know he is in the wrong.
I&rsquo;m afraid we&rsquo;ll quarrel again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, I should wait. He will come to
you in time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father will never do that,&rdquo; she said, sorrowfully.
&ldquo;I hurt him more than I had any
right.&rdquo; Searching the minister&rsquo;s face under
the dim light, she concluded: &ldquo;Please, Mr.
McGowan, don&rsquo;t blame Father too severely
for what happened last night! He is not himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss&ndash;&ndash;Elizabeth! Did you quarrel with
your father about me?&rdquo; His heart gave a
bound into his throat.</p>
<p>She nodded, looking for the world like a
child grown tall. Her eyes did not waver as
they met the hungry look in his own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About me?&rdquo; he repeated incredulously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A wild passion swept through him as he
listened to the quiet affirmative.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It began about you and the Athletic
Club. Father does not understand about
your work among the boys. It ended about
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
you and the action of the church last
night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that action was not voted through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know. But the end is not yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think that my relations with the
Boys&rsquo; Club is all that was behind the abortive
action last night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you advise me to give that work
up for a while till all this blows over?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, indeed!&rdquo; she declared strongly. &ldquo;I
think&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;Well, he says that you are not
orthodox. Do you need to preach like
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If my theology is of poor quality, I can&rsquo;t
help it. I can preach only what is truth and
reality to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But couldn&rsquo;t you be more careful how you
do it? Couldn&rsquo;t you be less frank, or something?
Should you antagonize your people
so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry if I have really antagonized any
one by what I say. Do you find anything unorthodox
in my sermons?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t a fair question to ask me. I&rsquo;m
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span>
not familiar with such things. I thought you
might preach less openly what you believe so
strenuously. Coat the pills so they&rsquo;ll go down
with the taste of orthodoxy.&rdquo; She smiled
faintly. &ldquo;I hate to see you putting weapons
in their hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do you honestly think I&rsquo;d be dealing
fair with myself or with those to whom I
preach to sugar-coat my thoughts with something
that looks like poison to me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did not reply, but with a quick look she
flashed from her wonderful eyes a message he
could not fail to catch even in the semi-darkness.
She dropped her hand lightly on his
sleeve, and his fingers quickly closed over
hers. She drew nearer. He could feel the
straying wisps of fair hair against his hot
cheek. His emotions taxed all his powers of
self-control.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must be going,&rdquo; she said, rising.
&ldquo;Oh, I forgot your foot! You must wait
here till I send the trap for you along the
beach.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do that. I&rsquo;ll get on very well, if
you&rsquo;ll help me a little.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Please, wait till I send Debbs. You&rsquo;ll
hurt yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your father might object to my riding in
his carriage,&rdquo; he remarked, with a light laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. McGowan, you must not talk like
that. I know you don&rsquo;t like him, but he is
really the best father in all the world!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forgive me, Miss Fox. I didn&rsquo;t mean to
be rude. I&rsquo;m afraid I was just trying to be
funny. As a matter of fact, I do like your
father, but there has been no opportunity&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you tried very hard to find an opportunity?
You&rsquo;ve stayed away from our
house pretty consistently, and have not
asked him one thing about the church work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I stayed away because I was requested
to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was only for the time he was ill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d be glad&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why will you grown men act like children
sometimes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Fox, please be seated again,&rdquo; requested
the minister, a note of authority in his
voice. &ldquo;I have something important to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
say to you, and the time may not come
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl obeyed, taking her place close beside
him on the stone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see you do not understand what has
brought this trouble between your father and
me. Neither do I, but I don&rsquo;t think that it&rsquo;s
a matter of doctrine. Nor do I believe that
it&rsquo;s the work I&rsquo;ve been doing down at the Inn
with the boys. Some cause strikes deeper
than both. They are merely excuses. You
remember that he made no objection to me in
the beginning along these lines, and I
preached no less strenuously then, as you call
it, than I do now. In fact, had it not been for
your father I doubt very much if the installation
had gone through last summer. Behind
the scenes there is another man, and he is pulling
the strings while he directs the play.
When I was ordained to the ministry in the
New York Presbytery, that man fought me
desperately, while he raised no objections to
others who were ordained at the same time,
and who held views far more radical than
mine. That man was at the installation.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
When your father told me that he was coming,
I made no protest, for I saw that there
was a fast friendship between the two. You
know what that man tried to do at the installation.
You doubtless know, too, that he has
been much with your father of late. You also
saw him at the meeting last night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Fox, if we knew all the facts, we
should be able to lay the blame for this trouble
and your father&rsquo;s condition right where it belongs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You refer to Mr. Means?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do. What it is&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. McGowan, if you think any man can
influence my father, you do not know him. I
dislike Mr. Means, maybe because he is so
preachy. But he cannot influence Father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I could believe that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must believe it. You are letting
your imagination color your judgment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should like to believe anything you tell
me, but I can&rsquo;t believe anything else than that
Mr. Means stands behind this whole mess.
Just why, I don&rsquo;t know, but it looks very
much as though there is a skeleton concealed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
in his closet, and he&rsquo;s afraid that I&rsquo;m going to
let it out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did you say that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I can&rsquo;t see what connection
I could possibly have with the man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are talking nonsense!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps, but truth sometimes masquerades
in the garb of the court fool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish to heaven I knew!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; She paused. She
searched his face, which was dimly and fitfully
lighted by the moonbeams as they broke
through the phantom-like clouds that were beginning
to sweep the heavens. &ldquo;Tell me,
please, just what it is you are thinking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dare not. But there is some reason not
yet come to light, and it is sheltered in the
mind of Mr. Means.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he knew you before you entered
the ministry?&rdquo; she half suggested, half questioned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no recollection of even so much as
meeting him before coming before the ordaining
Presbytery of which he was a member.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span>
So far as the history of my life is concerned,
he may find out the whole of it, if he so wishes.
It wouldn&rsquo;t make very interesting reading,
though. Miss Fox,&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;his voice took on the
quality of his earnestness,&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;if you have any
way of finding out what the actual cause is for
the conditions in my church, I shall do all in
my power to make amends, providing the
fault is mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you go to him? He might be
reasonable, and listen to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I go to him? Didn&rsquo;t I try to find
out what I had done till you and the doctor
forbid my coming again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean Father. Why don&rsquo;t you go
to Mr. Means?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you, if you were in my position?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She shook her head decidedly. &ldquo;But I
don&rsquo;t like him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps that may be my reason, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I thought all ministers had to love
everybody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might love the man, but not his
ways.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no merit in saying a thing like
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
that when a man and his ways are one and
the same thing, as is the case with Mr.
Means.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m honest when I say I have nothing
against Mr. Means. I don&rsquo;t know the man
well enough for that. I suppose he can&rsquo;t help
his ways.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, you&rsquo;ve gone and spoiled it. I was
beginning to think that you are like other
men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like other men?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Men who love and hate. I suppose you&rsquo;ll
be telling me next that you are really fond of
that man who fought you at the Inn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was a good boxer,&rdquo; was the enthusiastic
reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you like him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I might if I knew him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you fight everybody like that, and
still have love for them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Self-control is the better word. Unless
a man can learn that, he had better stay out
of the ring. What is true in boxing, is just
as true in life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, when there are those who threaten to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
wreck your whole life and your work, what
are you going to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is the time when one needs to summon
every ounce of self-control he possesses.
It is when the other man is seeking to land a
knock-out blow that one needs to keep his
head the coolest, for unless he does he can&rsquo;t
make his best calculations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mr. McGowan! You&rsquo;ll keep that
way in this trouble, and not let any of them
get in that kind of blow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, if you will only help me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I help you? But I can&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one else can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; cried the girl, beginning to take in
the meaning of his words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elizabeth&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say it, please!&rdquo; Her fingers went
to her lips in a hurt gesture. &ldquo;You may spoil
everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must speak. I love you! I have loved
you from the first day beneath that old elm-tree
on the Captain&rsquo;s place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;she sprang to her feet and faced
him,&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;now, you have made it impossible for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
me to help you, where before I might have
done something!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only if you say so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did so want to help you! You seem so
alone in this trouble! I thought you were going
to give me an opportunity. I thought
you would tell me how!&rdquo; Her mobile lips
puckered as the shadow of pain flitted across
the light of her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elizabeth!&rdquo; he called, holding out his
hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did you say that to me?&rdquo; she cried,
her youthful face deeply furrowed as though
she had grown suddenly very tired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I could not help it. I&rsquo;ve known
so little of love in my life that since this has
come to me it hurts like the turning of a
knife. I&rsquo;ve never been accustomed to human
care like other men. Had I been, I should
have been able to hide my feelings behind the
screen of pretense. You asked me a while
ago why I do not love and hate like other men.
I do love, and I hate! I have been schooled
all my life to hide my hates, but experience
neglected me with the other. Elizabeth&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span></div>
<p>She drew farther from him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I understand you,&rdquo; she said,
her eyes widening in the light of the moon
till they appeared like two shining orbs.
&ldquo;Have I given you any reason to think of me
like that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. But I thought&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She drew into the shadows that he might
not see the rapid rise and fall of her bosom.
&ldquo;Forgive me, if I have!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m the one to be forgiven. I&rsquo;ve never
had much instruction concerning social custom.
I was reared where they were little
known. In school I was too busy to bother
about them. I&rsquo;m crude. But, Elizabeth, I
love you. I see now that I&rsquo;ve no right to tell
you, but I couldn&rsquo;t help it. I&rsquo;ve been driven
to desperation. I have been like a caged animal
for weeks past. I&rsquo;ve been wild for just
a little love and understanding in the midst of
all I&rsquo;ve gone through. But you don&rsquo;t love
me!&rdquo; His breath was coming hard. He
trembled as he rose. &ldquo;You will love me some
day! God will not let a man love as I do and
give nothing in return!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span></div>
<p>Stirred with pity, Elizabeth came to him
from out the darkness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forgive me,&rdquo; he said as she came nearer.
&ldquo;I had no idea it would be like this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did not take the hand he extended, but
folding her arms behind her, she stood quite
still and stared. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry! But I don&rsquo;t
understand you at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You need not try. I don&rsquo;t understand
myself. I have never been through anything
like this in all my life. I thought instinct
would lead you right to me. I never questioned
but that you would understand. But
don&rsquo;t try, for I can&rsquo;t explain. This afternoon
I had just one thought: to tell you how
I love you. I thought it would make me
happy. Happy!&rdquo; He laughed bitterly. &ldquo;I
didn&rsquo;t stop to reason. It seems I have no reason.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. McGowan, please stop! You
frighten me,&rdquo; cried the girl, drawing away
again as he limped a step in her direction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hate!&rdquo; That one word was like the
sharp sudden sting of a whip. &ldquo;I hate this
age of social position, where money stands
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span>
above the man. I hate the shell of so-called
good families, as if lineage made the man,
instead of man making the lineage. I
hate&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must stop! Love that gives such
torment as you have been describing to me is
apt to turn out as nothing more than infatuation.
I care for you, but in no such way as
you have indicated to me. I want you for a
friend. Don&rsquo;t spoil that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He hobbled off down the beach as rapidly
as his limping foot could travel. The girl
came to his side and slipped her arm through
his. &ldquo;Lean on me just as heavily as you
like,&rdquo; she urged. &ldquo;I know you think me unkind
and cruel, but I do so want to help you.&rdquo;
Her voice broke unsteadily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you unkind, Miss Fox,&rdquo; replied
the minister as he accepted her proffered
assistance. &ldquo;The cruel thing is this that has
been burning within like fire. If you only
knew&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. McGowan,&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;she interrupted kindly,&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;I
cannot tell you as to the height of esteem
in which I hold you. Nothing can ever
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span>
harm that. But even if I cared for you as
you ask of me, don&rsquo;t you see how impossible
it would be for me to go back on Father? I
can&rsquo;t help but think there must be some real
reason for the attitude he has taken against
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you honestly believe what you have
just said?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there any reason why I should not believe
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose not,&rdquo; he replied, heavy fatigue
in his voice.</p>
<p>She saw from his averted face that her
question had pained him. She wanted to
speak, to soften her question, but no words
came to her dry lips.</p>
<p>The way home was traveled in silence.
They reached the pile of stones below her father&rsquo;s
place, and Elizabeth released her aching
arm. In silence they watched the
strangely mottled effect where the moonlight
fell in patches across the water as the clouds
flitted past. A patter of rain, accompanied
by a sharp whistle of wind, warned them of
coming storm.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go up the path with you, and go home
by the road,&rdquo; volunteered the minister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, indeed. It will be much easier walking
for you along the beach, and you&rsquo;ll not
need to climb any hill. I&rsquo;ll call to you from
the back gate, and you&rsquo;ll know I&rsquo;m safe.&rdquo;
She turned toward him once more. &ldquo;Harold
came home to-day, and Father has been
worse since that. Harold found out something
about the man he went over to Australia
to look up. He must have told Father about
it to-day. Since then he has been in a terrible
state of mind. It seems that Harold found
out something about you, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. McGowan was too surprised to reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Against you, Father says. I was not going
to tell you this, but you have compelled
me to do it by what you said to me. I know
nothing of your past life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Fox, will you be kind enough to explain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have nothing to explain. All I know is
that from the way Father acted it must not be
to your credit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked his amazement.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Good night,&rdquo; she said, extending her
hand. &ldquo;You will not forget what you said
about the way one should do in boxing, will
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He smiled faintly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. McGowan, you are not going to disappoint
me, are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would it make much difference? You
seem to have already formed your opinion
from the things you have heard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you are going to give up like that it
will make no difference what you do. I
thought you were more of a man than that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned and ran up the path. At the top
of the pile of stones she stopped, her slim outline
silhouetted in clear-cut lines against a
patch of moonlight, and her loosened hair giving
the suggestion of a halo as the mellow
light played through. She lifted her hand as
she declared, &ldquo;And you are more of a man.
I do not believe that whatever Father thinks
he has found out can harm you in the least.
That is what we really quarreled about to-day.
Does that tell you how much I care?
&lsquo;Now is the time when you need to summon
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span>
every ounce of self-control you possess.
When other men are seeking to land the
knock-out blow you should keep your head
the coolest, for unless you do you cannot
make your best calculations.&rsquo; You see, I
have not forgotten, and neither must you.
And in everything, Mack,&rdquo; she finished, hurriedly.</p>
<p>The rear gate clicked, and she sent him a
light trill.</p>
<p>The minister went to his study as soon as
he reached home. For hours he sat, his mind
a blank. He was roused at last by the opening
of his <a name='TC_8'></a><ins class="tnchg" title=" &#34;spelling standardized&#34;">study door</ins>. He looked up into the
face of his old friend. The blue eyes, usually
clear and steady, had a faded look as though
the fire in them had suddenly gone out.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been shut up with the most onreasonable
feller I ever see in all my life,&rdquo; said the
Captain to the unasked question in the minister&rsquo;s
eyes. &ldquo;I cal&rsquo;late I&rsquo;ll keep my thoughts
to myself to-night, Mack, and sleep on them.
The way I feel wouldn&rsquo;t be conducive to
prayer-meeting language. Good night, son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was scarcely daylight when Miss Pipkin
began work in the kitchen on the following
morning. Shortly afterward the Captain
descended.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Morning, Clemmie.&rdquo; He held the
kitchen door ajar, and his voice wavered as
he spoke.</p>
<p>Miss Pipkin did not reply. The Captain,
to reinforce his courage, stepped back into
the dining-room. Miss Pipkin walked over
and closed the door. This spurred the seaman
to action. He cautiously pushed the door
open again, and peeped through a narrow
crack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clemmie, be you in there?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Where else do you think I&rsquo;d be, down
the well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t I talk to you, Clemmie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. I don&rsquo;t want you to come sneaking
into my kitchen at this hour in the morning.
You ought to be in bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A note of friendliness in her voice led him
to open the door a little wider.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re up too early, Clemmie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a lot of work to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you ain&rsquo;t too busy, I&rsquo;d like awful well
to speak to you about something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I am busy, leastwise too busy to be
bothered with your nonsense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t foolishness this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Something in his tone made her look up
into the face framed in the crack of the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Josiah!&rdquo; she cried at sight of the drawn
features.</p>
<p>He threw open the door and entered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. McGowan ain&rsquo;t sick this morning, is
he?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Leastwise he wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t when I passed
the time of night or early morning with him
on my way to bed.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sick, Josiah?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I got might be called that, Clemmie.
I&rsquo;m sick of the hull damn round of life,&rdquo;
he said, despondently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Josiah Pott! How you do talk! What
do you mean by it, anyhow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Purty much as I say. I&rsquo;m always bungling
things of late. I&ndash;&ndash;well&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, you set down in that chair, and
stop staring at me for all the world like an old
wood-owl, &rsquo;most scaring the wits out of me.
One would think you&rsquo;d gone clean out of your
head. I never heard you talk so in all my
born days. If you ain&rsquo;t sick, you&rsquo;re in a heap
of trouble. Now, do as I tell you and set
down. Tell me what&rsquo;s wrong, that is if that&rsquo;s
what you come down for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I come down, Clemmie,&rdquo; he
said, slouching into one of the kitchen chairs.
&ldquo;I heerd you come down-stairs, and I just
had to follow. Fust of all, I want to tell you
how bad I feel about them things I said yesterday
morning that hurt your feelings so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the lan&rsquo; sakes! Be that what&rsquo;s ailing
you? I thought it was something that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
amounted to something,&rdquo; she declared, the
color rising into her faded cheeks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That does amount to something. It
means a lot to me. That ain&rsquo;t all, but I
wanted to get it off my chest fust. I was
never intending less to hurt nobody than
when I said that to you. I thought &rsquo;twould
cheer you and Mack up a little; you was both
looking a mite blue. You&rsquo;re a good woman,
Clemmie, and any man that&rsquo;d insult you
would have me to settle with purty tolerable
quick. You know how much I think of
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be you beginning to propose again?&rdquo;
she asked, her arms akimbo. &ldquo;If that&rsquo;s
what&rsquo;s ailing you, and you&rsquo;re asking my pardon
just to get ready to ask me&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get mad, Clemmie. No, I ain&rsquo;t
going to get down on my old prayer-bones,
they&rsquo;re a mite too squeaky, though I&rsquo;d be willing
enough to do it if I thought it would do
any good. I ain&rsquo;t going to pester you any
more about that. You know your mind, and
it ain&rsquo;t right for me to be disturbing it at my
time of life.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Then, Josiah, if you ain&rsquo;t love-sick, what
is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe that&rsquo;s a part of what&rsquo;s ailing me.
But what I want you to say this morning is
that you ain&rsquo;t got nothing against me for
what I said yesterday about you taking to sea
in my dory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Josiah, that was awful foolish in me.
You&rsquo;d best forgive me, too, for the way I
acted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, Clemmie. You&rsquo;ve sartinly done
me many a good turn, and it would be a wonder
if I wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t in love with you. You&rsquo;ve
always been mighty good and kind to me.
But, there, don&rsquo;t you get excited again,
I ain&rsquo;t going to say nothing more about
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me about your trouble, Josiah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old seaman pulled hard at the ends of
his ragged moustache, and his voice grew
husky. &ldquo;I felt just like I had to tell somebody.
I was going to tell Mack last night
when I see a light in his study, but when I
went in I see he had all he could tote, so I just
went on up to my room without telling him....
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
You know I&rsquo;ve been out of a job for
quite a spell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has been long for you,&rdquo; nodded Miss
Pipkin as she drew another chair opposite.
&ldquo;But you&rsquo;ve got the church to look after.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That ain&rsquo;t my trade, and it comes hard.
I feel all the time like I&rsquo;d clumb onto the
wrong deck. I&rsquo;d hoped to get a ship afore
now. Jim promised me one, and&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean you&rsquo;ve been expecting to
get a ship through Jim Fox? Why, Josiah
Pott! He&rsquo;d not give you a splinter to hang
on if you was drowning. Depending on him!
Pooh! I thought you had more sense than
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I ain&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m just what I&rsquo;ve told you
afore, an old fool. I cal&rsquo;late I know how you
feel about Jim. I&rsquo;d always felt that way, too,
till he come honeying round me this spring.
You called me once an old fool with good intentions.
I cal&rsquo;late you ain&rsquo;t far off in your
soundings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never said that!&rdquo; she rejoined. &ldquo;Anyhow,
I didn&rsquo;t mean it like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need to excuse what you said.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span>
It&rsquo;s God&rsquo;s truth. That&rsquo;s exactly what I
be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t, neither, and I don&rsquo;t see why
you want to talk that way. What I don&rsquo;t see,
neither, is why you want to go hanging round,
waiting for that man to give you a ship.
There&rsquo;s plenty of others that would be glad
to get you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t sartin &rsquo;bout that last p&rsquo;int. You
see, I ain&rsquo;t so young no more. I&rsquo;m getting
up in years, and ship-owners ain&rsquo;t hiring none
but young men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense! There you go again. As
long as you think and talk like Methuselah
there ain&rsquo;t no owner going to take a chance on
you for fear you&rsquo;d forget the name of the port
he&rsquo;d ordered you to. You get that idea out
of your head along with the notion that Jim
Fox is going to help you, and you&rsquo;ll get a
ship. The very best there is afloat, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s mighty kind of you to say that, Clemmie.
I cal&rsquo;late the notion about Jim is purty
well shook out. That&rsquo;s one thing I wanted to
talk to you about. You know the old place
here had been sort of run down for a good
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
many year. I&rsquo;d always held to the idea that
some day I&rsquo;d come back here after I&rsquo;d got
rich, remodel the home, and get the best
woman in all the world to ship side by side
with me as best mate. I&rsquo;ve told you all that
afore, many the time, Clemmie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Pipkin barely nodded. The suggestion
of moisture gathered in her eyes as she
gazed at the tragic face before her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m back, and it looks like it was
for good and all, but I ain&rsquo;t got no money, and
I don&rsquo;t see no way to get any unless I rob
somebody. And the law won&rsquo;t let me do that.
The trouble is that I&rsquo;m up to my gunwales in
debt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In debt!&rdquo; To Miss Pipkin&rsquo;s mind there
was no greater calamity in the world than to
be in debt. She, too, had suffered a like fate
many years ago.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. In bad, too. Jim come up to my
house last spring just afore the minister took
up his new quarters here, and he says to me:
&lsquo;Here&rsquo;s some money to repair your place
with. There&rsquo;ll be no interest on it. It&rsquo;s because
of my civic pride in the affairs of Little
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span>
River that I make you this liberal offer.&rsquo;
Well, it did look too good to be true, but I
couldn&rsquo;t see nothing wrong, and he promised
me on his word to see that I got a ship, the
very next one his company was to send out.
I ain&rsquo;t much up on them legal papers. I ain&rsquo;t
had nothing to do with any kind of papers for
years &rsquo;cepting owners&rsquo; orders. I took his
word for &rsquo;em being straight. I wouldn&rsquo;t have
took a cent of the money if them papers had
been straight as the Bible, but he promised me
so fair and square to place me that I fell for
him hard. You know he&rsquo;s one of the owners
of the Atlantic Coastwise Trading Company.
Well, I went right down to the city next day,
and for several days I hung round. Then,
they told me another feller got in ahead of
me. When I was going out I see Jim in one
of them little glass rooms talking earnest-like
to some of his partners, and I heerd him
speak my name. I knew right off that there
was something up the mizzenmast. I come
home, and waited. It was then I found
Mack in the house. Mrs. Beaver put him in
here while I was away. I also found the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span>
painters all over the place. I knew right off
that Jim had me on the hip, but I couldn&rsquo;t
make out what his game was. Yesterday the
thing come tumbling down on my head; a
lawyer brought it. Them papers I signed up
has turned out to be a mortgage on my old
home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Pipkin gasped. &ldquo;A mortgage and a
lawyer was here to see you yesterday?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They sure was. One of &rsquo;em brung the
other, and I had to meet &rsquo;em both alone.
They seemed real glad to see me, but I wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t
none too friendly with either of &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Josiah, stop your joking. You say there
was a lawyer here to see you, and he brought
a mortgage on your place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man looked away and cleared his
throat. &ldquo;The feller come from the city. He
showed me how them papers called for a settlement
afore the fust of November. I ain&rsquo;t
got a chance in the hull world to get hold of
any money afore then. He said something
about a foreclosure, too, and he said that
meant I was to lose my place. He see how
hard I took it, and was real kind. He said
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span>
he&rsquo;d come all the way from the city just to
let me know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kind! Pooh! You&rsquo;d better have showed
him the door like you told me you did Harry
Beaver.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t his fault, Clemmie. He was
real sorry. He was just doing his duty. He
offered to buy the place after I&rsquo;d showed him
about. What he said he&rsquo;d give wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t what
it&rsquo;s wuth by a heap, but it would pay Jim off
and leave me a mite.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Offered to buy it, did he? Well, you
didn&rsquo;t tell him you&rsquo;d sell, did you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not for sartin, I didn&rsquo;t. I told him I&rsquo;d
think it over a spell and let him know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him know! Pooh! I should say you
will think it over, and for a purty long
spell, too. You ain&rsquo;t going to sell a foot
of it! That feller wasn&rsquo;t here for himself.
He was playing one of Jim Fox&rsquo;s tricks on
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Clemmie,&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Josiah, you mark my word, that lawyer
feller was here to buy this place for Jim Fox.
It&rsquo;s as plain as the nose on your face, and I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
don&rsquo;t need to look twice to see that. Don&rsquo;t
you dare to sell one inch of this place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Captain rubbed the organ to which
Miss Pipkin referred, and thought for some
time. &ldquo;Suppose your guess is right, and he
did come for Jim, there ain&rsquo;t nothing left for
me but to sell. That&rsquo;s better than losing
everything.&rdquo; He tried to clear his husky
voice. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s kind of hard. I&rsquo;ve got you and
the minister here now, and I&rsquo;m sort of obligated
to you both. It&rsquo;s kind of hard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Obligated, fiddlesticks! I ain&rsquo;t so young
that I can&rsquo;t take care of myself, nor so old,
neither. I&rsquo;ll get on all right, and the minister,
too, for that matter.&rdquo; Her voice dropped
with an unsteady quality. &ldquo;But what you&rsquo;re
going to do, I can&rsquo;t see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shook his head wearily. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been
trying to see some way all night long, but I
can&rsquo;t, &rsquo;cepting to sell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Josiah,&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;she crossed over and laid her
hand on his shoulder,&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;there&rsquo;s a picture in
the setting-room that says beneath it something
like this: &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t Give Up the Ship.&rsquo; I
was looking at it yesterday after I&rsquo;d been so
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
silly about what you said to me. I must have
been sent to the picture for a purpose in this
hour of our trial. We ain&rsquo;t going to give up
the ship, not till we have to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he&rsquo;s got the law on his side, and I
ain&rsquo;t got nothing on mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got a clear conscience, and that&rsquo;s
more than all the law with which he&rsquo;s clothing
his guilty mind. And, then,&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;she eyed him
closely,&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;you&rsquo;ve got me. Does that help?
We ain&rsquo;t going to run up the white flag till we
have to, and I don&rsquo;t care if he&rsquo;s got the whole
creation on his side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He rose and laid his rough palm over the
bony fingers on his shoulder. &ldquo;Do you mean
that you&rsquo;re going to stick by me, Clemmie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cal&rsquo;late that&rsquo;ll help a heap, even if
things go dead against me. It&rsquo;s purty nigh
three weeks afore he can close up on me,&rdquo; he
faltered, as though he dared not hope even in
the presence of this unexpected aid that had
come to him. &ldquo;What are we going to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fust thing you&rsquo;re going to do is to see
Jim Fox himself, and you&rsquo;re going to tell him
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span>
that you&rsquo;re going to see a good lawyer, the
best you can find. If them papers ain&rsquo;t
straight he&rsquo;ll show plain that he&rsquo;s worried.&rdquo;
She drew her hand from his. &ldquo;Josiah, I&rsquo;m
going to show you something I ain&rsquo;t ever
showed to a living soul. It ain&rsquo;t much, but it
might start you along the right way of finding
something out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She went to her room, and soon returned
with a piece of paper. It was yellow with
age, and had to be handled with care to keep
it from falling apart at the creases. She
handed it to the Captain, indicating a section
for him to read. He nearly tumbled from his
chair as the truth it conveyed concerning the
past life of Jim Fox flashed into his mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Holy mackerel!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The entrance of the minister prevented
further comment, except for the Captain to
whisper:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, Clemmie. &rsquo;Twill help, I cal&rsquo;late.
You&rsquo;re a good woman,&rdquo; he finished, taking
her hand between both of his. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
smart, too. You&rsquo;ve helped me more than you
know, and God bless you!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
</div>
<p>That evening the Captain dropped the
brass knocker to the Elder&rsquo;s front door with
a heavy thud. A servant opened the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to see Mr. Fox.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not in, sir. Will you leave any&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is it, Debbs?&rdquo; called a voice from
the top of the stair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain Pott, sir. I thought you was to
see no one to-night, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right. Send him right up to
my room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Elder&rsquo;s den was across the hall from
his daughter&rsquo;s room, in the most quiet part of
the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right in here, Josiah. We shall be more
private here than down-stairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Captain entered, and took the chair indicated
by the Elder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was very busy, and told Debbs I was
not to be disturbed, but I recognized your
voice, and&ndash;&ndash;er&ndash;&ndash;wanted to see you. It has
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span>
been quite a long while since we have had a
friendly chat, Josiah. I wish you would come
more often. I get very lonesome in this big
place. Have a cigar? No? I shall, if you
don&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We ain&rsquo;t been none too neighborly, as you
might say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you come up once in a
while?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cal&rsquo;late for the same reason you don&rsquo;t get
over to the other end of the road. For one
thing, I&rsquo;m too busy paying off debts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Elder looked questioningly at the seaman
as he touched the lighted end of a match
to his cigar. &ldquo;That is true. We&ndash;&ndash;er&ndash;&ndash;are
busy, too busy for our own good. We ought
to be more sociable here in Little River. We
need something to stir us up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re too damn selfish, if you ask me.
As far as stirring goes, I cal&rsquo;late we&rsquo;ve got
as much of that as any town along this coast.
About all a feller can do is to set his teeth
against the hurricane and grin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Elder laughed without restraint, and
his visitor began to show signs of uneasiness.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d best be careful with them delicate
blood-vessels,&rdquo; mildly suggested the Captain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;True, Josiah. But that was a good joke,
a very good joke. One can take it in two
ways.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not the way I mean it. There&rsquo;s enough
gossip&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we are too selfish,&rdquo; broke in the
Elder, &ldquo;and it is too bad. I often think of the
time we were kids together. We had our little
scraps, made up, and were ready to fight
for each other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Captain could recall no occasion when
he had fought for Jim Fox.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long ago that all seems! Yet how&ndash;&ndash;er&ndash;&ndash;happy
were those days. No cares. No
sorrows. No troubles. No misunderstandings.
Excuse me, Josiah. I don&rsquo;t know why
it is that I hark back like this when we get together.
But it does me a world of good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe you&rsquo;ve got another fish to fry,&rdquo;
suggested the Captain, wholly untouched by
the Elder&rsquo;s memory picture. &ldquo;That was the
way you done when you wanted us boys to do
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span>
something for you, and you ain&rsquo;t got over it
with age.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was quite a diplomat in those days,
wasn&rsquo;t I? But we can&rsquo;t bring them back.
No, sir, we can&rsquo;t. They are&ndash;&ndash;er&ndash;&ndash;gone forever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t sartin I want to fetch &rsquo;em back.
Leastwise, that wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t my purpose in coming
here to-night. I come over to see you about
that mortgage you slipped over on me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mortgage?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, mortgage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! You refer to that little loan I made
you some time ago? That was&ndash;&ndash;er&ndash;&ndash;real humor
calling it a mortgage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be funny to you, but it ain&rsquo;t to
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope that little matter isn&rsquo;t bothering
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t, but a feller from the city is. He
told me you was intending to take my place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry he told you that. I do not
know what I should do with it if I had it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;d do without it,
Jim.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I think it can be arranged without difficulty.
It is such a small matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may look small to you, but it looks a
heap sight different to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, Josiah. It is very opportune
that you have come to me to-night. Not
more than an hour ago I was thinking of you,
and wishing I might&ndash;&ndash;er&ndash;&ndash;see you. I have
been thinking, too, of others, some who stood
by me in time of peril and poverty. I feel
greatly indebted to them, and since they were
members of your family, I must now show my
appreciation for their kindness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cal&rsquo;late you&rsquo;re referring to them you
served a dirty trick over in Australia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Josiah! I have told you a hundred
times that I was never in Australia,&rdquo; declared
the other, paling slightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so, you have, Jim. Excuse me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I was saying,&rdquo; he continued, showing
great relief, &ldquo;I feel indebted to them, and I
want to pay back&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, Jim, you needn&rsquo;t offer none of
your blood money. It don&rsquo;t look good to
me.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span></div>
<p>It was a bold stroke, but it went home.
The color crept slowly from the Elder&rsquo;s sanguine
face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no intention of offering you charity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know damn well you dasn&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m
not speaking of charity, and you know that,
too, Jim. I&rsquo;m speaking of blood money, and
I mean just what I say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are still the same doubting Thomas,
I see. Do you recall how you were always
the last one&ndash;&ndash;er&ndash;&ndash;to be won over to a new enterprise?&rdquo;
The Elder tried to smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had good reason to go slow. A mite of
caution is a purty fair endowment of nature
where some people&rsquo;s schemes is concerned. If
I&rsquo;d used a little of it last spring I&rsquo;d not be in
the fix I am to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that bump of caution on your head is
pretty hard on your friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cal&rsquo;late it won&rsquo;t hurt my friends none.
We wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t speaking of them just then. Anyhow,
it&rsquo;s kept me with a clean conscience to
sleep with, and I&rsquo;d a heap sight rather ship
with clear rigging than be ballasted with some
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span>
people&rsquo;s money and have to make bedfellows
with their conscience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&ndash;&ndash;er&ndash;&ndash;ahem&ndash;&ndash;quite true,&rdquo; was the
hasty reply. &ldquo;What can I do for you, Josiah?
If I can be of the least service,&ndash;&ndash;er&ndash;&ndash;I
shall be only too glad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It depends on what you&rsquo;ve got to offer
me. The fust thing I&rsquo;d like to suggest is that
you stop that there er-ing and hem-ing.
There ain&rsquo;t no one here but me, and it don&rsquo;t
make no impression. Being that you&rsquo;re so
infernal anxious to get back to boyhood
days we might just as well go all-hog on
it. You didn&rsquo;t try none of that foolishness
then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What you say is quite true.&rdquo; The Elder
stroked his chops thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t have them things to pet,
neither. You might just as well stop that.
It makes me nervous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elder Fox eyed him narrowly. He had a
mind to tell this man to leave his house at
once. He even entertained the thought that
it might be a good thing to call Debbs and
have him put out. But a certain fear, which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span>
had for years haunted the Elder, laid a cold
restraining hand on his inclinations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Josiah, those are habits that I have
formed in business. Dealing with so many
different kinds of men makes us do odd things
at times, and if repeated often enough they
become habits. I have always tried to be
courteous even to men that bore me, and I
presume I took on those senseless little syllables
to temper my natural brusqueness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you don&rsquo;t need &rsquo;em to-night, and
you can be as brusque as you like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before we speak of that little matter between
us, I have something else I want to say.
When we have finished, I trust there will be
no need to mention the other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s advice you&rsquo;re wanting to give, I&rsquo;ll
tell you right off that I&rsquo;ve had enough of it.
What I need is time on that mortgage you
and your crooked lawyer put over on me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There may be lots of money in what I
have to propose. In fact, there is, if you do
as I say. How badly do you want a ship to
man and command?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here, Jim, I ain&rsquo;t in no frame of mind
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span>
to be fooled with to-night. If you don&rsquo;t
mean just what you&rsquo;re going to say, you&rsquo;d
best not say it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean every word of it, but I shall expect
more consideration and respect from you
before I open my mouth again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re in dead earnest, Jim, I beg your
pardon. This damn mortgage has got on my
nerves purty bad. Heave over your proposition,
and get it off your chest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall have to exact one promise from
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Captain took one step toward the
Elder&rsquo;s chair, his swarthy old face alight with
anticipation and hope. One promise! He
would give a hundred, and keep them all.
The Captain was fine-looking at all times,
every span of him a man and a seaman. But
when his face was bright with eagerness, and
his muscular body tense with anticipation, he
was superb. To those less steeled against human
magnetism than Mr. Fox, he was irresistible
at such times. The Elder merely
waved him back to the vacated chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That one promise will bind us both,&rdquo; he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span>
said coldly. &ldquo;In fact, it is to your interest
as well as to mine to make it. You will not
see it at first, but time will prove that I am
right in asking it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll promise anything that&rsquo;s reasonable if
you&rsquo;ll only swing me the job of skipper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well.&rdquo; The Elder began to shuffle
some papers with deft fingers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that there mortgage, Jim, is soon
due, and&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall not speak of that for the present.
There are other ways of disposing of
mortgages than by paying them,&rdquo; he remarked,
striking a match and holding it significantly
beneath a piece of paper which the
Captain recognized as the one displayed by
the lawyer yesterday.</p>
<p>Captain Pott did not take his eyes from the
face of the man across the table. A suspicion
was forcing its way into his mind,
and it was as unpleasant as it was unwelcome.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do I know that you&rsquo;ll keep your end
of the promise, Jim?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have my word.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I had that afore, at the time you give
me that money, but it didn&rsquo;t get me nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not remember that I gave any definite
promise. I said I would do my best for
you, and I did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe you done your best, but&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll not quarrel about that. There is
nothing indefinite about the position I have to
offer you this time. I have the papers here
on my table, and the command is yours in less
than five minutes after you make the promise.
At the same time the note for my loan to you
goes into the fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, is there any special reason why you
should take so long to get this thing off your
chest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want you to realize the importance of
the request I have to make.&rdquo; The Elder
threw aside what little mask he had been
wearing. An imperious note crept into his
voice, giving it a hard metallic ring. &ldquo;It is
time for you to recognize, Josiah, that I have
you about where I want you. I can make or
ruin you in five minutes, and it all depends on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span>
how you reply now. Think hard before you
answer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, Jim, you&rsquo;ve got me with a
purty tight hip-hold,&rdquo; admitted the Captain.
&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m waiting just now for them orders
to see if I&rsquo;m going to sign up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll sign up, I&rsquo;m not afraid of that.
That is, if you really wish to keep your place.
The promise that you are to make to me
is concerning the man staying in your
house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Pott stiffened, and threw up his
guard. He carefully concealed his rising anger,
however. He must be more certain of
his ground before he made any leap that
might prove dangerous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What in tarnation has he got to do with
this affair?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has everything to do with it, so far as
you are concerned at this particular moment.
We must get that man out of this town. You
must believe me when I tell you that such action
is as much to your interest as mine. If
he is permitted to stay here&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heave to, there, Jim!&rdquo; exploded the seaman.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span>
He leaned across the table and glared
at the man on the other side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, now, sit down and compose yourself,&rdquo;
soothed the Elder. &ldquo;I was prepared
for you to take it this way at first. I don&rsquo;t
mean anything against the man, so far as his
personal character is concerned, but his presence
here is a decided menace both to you and
me. If I dared to tell you the whole truth,
you, too, would see the sense of my request.
It is best that he go for his own good, too.
Some physical violence will certainly be done
him if he remains. You must see with me
that it is best on that one point that we remove
him quietly from the town. Sim Hicks has
sworn to do him harm. Now, you are the
logical man to go to Mr. McGowan, and show
him the sense of his leaving Little River.
You seem to be the only one who can influence
him in any degree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the Almighty, Jim Fox! If it wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t
for your darter, I&rsquo;d swipe up this floor with
your dirty carcass!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be best if you take this calmly,
Josiah, and stop your foolish raving. Just
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span>
listen to reason for once in your life. There
is a past in that man&rsquo;s life known to a very
select few. I came across it accidentally. If
it became known it would create no end of
scandal and ruin our little church. That man
had no good intention in putting in his request
for the Little River pulpit. What is
more, he is not a real minister of the gospel.
He is using it merely as a pretext.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Captain caught his breath. &ldquo;He ain&rsquo;t
a minister? What do you mean by that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing more than what it conveys to
your mind. I cannot tell you more, just
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jim, you&rsquo;re lying to me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be careful, Josiah. You are making a
very serious charge, and I may decide to make
you prove it in court.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The seaman reached into his coat-pocket
for the yellow bit of paper which Miss Pipkin
had given him that morning. But he quickly
withdrew his hand without the paper. The
thought flashed through his mind that he
could not prove with certainty the truth of the
message written thereon.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got something here in my pocket
that&rsquo;d interest you a heap, Jim. But I ain&rsquo;t
able to prove it all, so it can wait for a spell.
But if it leads in the direction I think it does,
the Lord pity you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d advise you to hold your tongue, as it
might get you into trouble. If you will drop
all that foolishness about getting even with
me for imaginary wrongs, we shall be able to
talk business. Here are the receipts for the
full amount I loaned you, and here are papers
waiting your signature and mine that will put
you in command of the best vessel put out by
our company in many years. It all depends
now on your willingness to help me get Mr.
McGowan out of our town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Fox shoved the papers temptingly
across the table, keeping one hand on the corner
of them. The Captain appeared to waver.
Of course, he acknowledged, it did seem
easy. But he did not touch the papers. He
rather drew back as though they were deadly
poison. He eyed the Elder narrowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what do you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jim Fox,&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;began the seaman slowly, his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span>
voice lowering with the rise of his anger,&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;you&rsquo;re
a white-livered coward! You&rsquo;ve always
been getting others to do your dirty
work for you, and I&rsquo;m sartin now that you&rsquo;re
offering me a bribe to help stack your damn
cards against Mack. There ain&rsquo;t money
enough in the world to make me do that. I
see your game just as plain as though you&rsquo;d
written it out like you done them papers.
You mean to wreck Mack&rsquo;s life, and you&rsquo;re
asking me to sit in with you and the devil
while you do it. You mean to throw him out
of a job, and you mean to keep him from getting
another by working through that Means
hypocrite. Yes, I can see through you, as
plain as a slit canvas. There&rsquo;s something
infernal back of all this, and that something is
your goat. You&rsquo;re skeered that the minister
is going to get it, and that&rsquo;s what is ailing you.
By God! I&rsquo;ll be on deck to help him, whether
he&rsquo;s a preacher or a detective from Australia
looking for crooks. You&rsquo;ve been lying all
these years about where you made your
money. You&rsquo;ve been telling that you got it
in Africa, trading in diamonds. I&rsquo;ve got a
piece of paper in my pocket that blows up
your lies like dynamite. You was in Australia
all them years. By the Almighty! I&rsquo;m
going to sign up with the preacher, and I
don&rsquo;t care a tinker&rsquo;s dam if you get the last
cent I have, and send me up Riverhead way
to the Poor Farm to eat off the county.
Foreclose on my property! That ain&rsquo;t no
more than you&rsquo;ve been doing to others all your
miserable life. It ain&rsquo;t no more than you
done to Clemmie Pipkin years ago, leaving
her nothing to live on. But mine will be the
last you&rsquo;ll foreclose on, and I&rsquo;m going to see
one or two of the best lawyers in the city afore
you do that!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Captain strode from the room and
down the stair. Mr. Fox called feebly, begging
him to return. But the seaman was deaf
with rage, and he left the house without hearing
the mumbled petition of an apparently
penitent Elder.</p>
<p>Captain Pott half ran, half stumbled, down
to the wharf. He hurriedly untied his dory,
and rowed out to the <i>Jennie P.</i> A little later
he anchored his power-boat in the harbor of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span>
Little River where the railroad station was
located. He rowed ashore, secured his dory,
and ran to the depot. He climbed aboard the
city-bound train just as it began to move.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
</div>
<p>Daylight was beginning to peep through
the morning darkness when the Captain
threaded his way along the crooked path to
the rear of his house. He drew off his boots
outside the kitchen door, and tiptoed to his
room. Without removing his clothing he
threw himself on the bed. The sunlight was
streaming through the eastern windows when
he awoke. He stretched himself off the bed,
and threw back the covers so that Miss Pipkin
would think he had slept there the night
through. He went down to the kitchen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything special to tell me this morning,
Josiah?&rdquo; whispered the housekeeper as he entered.
&ldquo;How pale you look! Ain&rsquo;t been
seeing ghosts, have you? You look like one
yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe &rsquo;twas ghosts I see, but they looked
purty tolerable real to me. Yes, Clemmie,
I&rsquo;ve sartin been looking on things what ain&rsquo;t
good for a healthy man to see. One of &rsquo;em is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span>
that I&rsquo;m a ruined man, and there ain&rsquo;t no help
for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk such nonsense! Get out and
fill your lungs with fresh air. That cures the
blues quicker than anything I know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t cure this fit. If it would, I&rsquo;d
had it cured long ago, &rsquo;cause that&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;ve
been doing for a good many weeks. If I&rsquo;d
talked less and done more I&rsquo;d been a heap
sight better off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought from the way you was staying
up there last night that you was doing something.
I never heerd you come in at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe I wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t up there all that time.
The fact is, Clemmie, I went into the city last
night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You went into New York last night?
What did you do that for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I went in and pulled a lawyer friend of
mine out of bed for a little confab. I don&rsquo;t
mind telling you who it was. It was Harold
Fox.... Clemmie, that feller that was
here to see me about that mortgage lied to me
about the date it was due. Harold says the
time is up on it next Saturday.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Josiah!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I also talked with another friend of mine
who knew Jim purty well in his palmy days,
and he says what that letter of yours says is
so. He told me a lot more stuff, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What? About Jim or Adoniah?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Both. What would you do if there wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t
no way to save my place excepting by ruination
of the other feller?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d see him stop for you, wouldn&rsquo;t
you? I&rsquo;d not give it a second thought, I&rsquo;d
just&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That ain&rsquo;t it, Clemmie. There&rsquo;s his darter,
the sweetest little thing that God ever
made. It would kill her, and I ain&rsquo;t got no
right to hurt her just to save my own skin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, Josiah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what I&rsquo;m to do, I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. McGowan entered with an armful of
wood, and as he stooped to drop it into the
box Miss Pipkin looked sorrowfully at the
Captain and shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done my best,&rdquo; said the seaman,
slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d think he was making his last will
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span>
and testament from the way he&rsquo;s talking,&rdquo; remarked
Miss Pipkin, trying hard to appear as
though she was without the least concern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe I be, Clemmie. Maybe I be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the cause for all this dejection?&rdquo;
asked the minister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cause enough, Mack.... I&rsquo;ll be
going back to the city to-morrow. I hate to
leave you to the wiles of the menagerie, for if
I ain&rsquo;t terrible mistook they&rsquo;re out for your
blood, and they think they&rsquo;ve got a whiff of it.
But I cal&rsquo;late they&rsquo;ve got their ropes crossed.
They&rsquo;ve got the idea they&rsquo;re h&rsquo;isting the
mains&rsquo;l, but it ain&rsquo;t nothing but the spanker.
If I was going to stay aboard I&rsquo;d give &rsquo;em a
few lessons the next few days that they&rsquo;d not
forget all the rest of their lives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re certainly mixing your figures in
great shape this morning,&rdquo; commented the
minister good-naturedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if mixing figures is like mixing
drinks, making &rsquo;em more elevating to the
thoughts, I cal&rsquo;late I&rsquo;d best do a little more
mixing. There&rsquo;s going to be a squall right
soon that&rsquo;ll test the ribs of the old salvation
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span>
ark to the cracking p&rsquo;int. If I was you I&rsquo;d
furl my sails a mite, and stand by, Mack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re so accustomed to trouble now
that&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trouble? This is going to be hell, that
is, unless luck or Providence takes a hand
and steers her through. Your Elder thinks
he&rsquo;s on the home stretch to winning his laurels,
but if I was going to hang round here he&rsquo;d
wake up right sudden one of these fine mornings
to find his wreath missing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Josiah, you&rsquo;re as wicked as you can be this
morning. What on earth has come over
you?&rdquo; exclaimed Miss Pipkin with deep concern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d feel wicked, too, if you was dealing
with that kind. But that there Elder puts
me in mind of a tramp printer that come to
work for Adoniah one time. Adoniah was a
brother of mine,&rdquo; he explained in answer to a
quizzing look from the minister. &ldquo;Adoniah
was managing a country paper down the line
then, and being short on help he took this
tramp printer on. He gave him something
to set up that the editor had writ,&ndash;&ndash;you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span>
couldn&rsquo;t tell one of the letters of that editor
from t&rsquo;other, hardly,&ndash;&ndash;and that feller had a
time with it. The piece was about some chap
that was running for office, and it closed up
with something like this: &lsquo;Dennis, my boy,
look well to your laurels.&rsquo; When that tramp
got through with it, it come back to the editor
like this: &lsquo;Dammit, my boy, bark well at your
barrels.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. McGowan laughed heartily, and Miss
Pipkin struggled against a like inclination,
doing her best to appear shocked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Josiah Pott!&rdquo; she said at last. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
think you&rsquo;d be ashamed telling such things!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t nothing more than what Adoniah
told, and it happened just as I spun it. You
used to think what Adoniah said was all
right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The minister sobered instantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it ain&rsquo;t right defaming the dead like
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t defaming no one. Don&rsquo;t get mad,
Clemmie. Adoniah told the yarn himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it ain&rsquo;t to his credit, and I ain&rsquo;t so
sure he told it with that bad word in it.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;He sartin did. That&rsquo;s what makes it
funny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you wasn&rsquo;t so anxious to use them
words you&rsquo;d not be telling such stories, and, of
all people, to the minister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s heerd me say lots worse ones than
that. I was telling it for illustration. You
see, Jim has got the idea that he&rsquo;s looking to
his laurels, and he ain&rsquo;t doing nothing but
barking at his barrels, and empty ones at
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d best not try to illustrate if you
can&rsquo;t use words decent enough to listen to,&rdquo;
answered Miss Pipkin as she left the room.</p>
<p>Late that evening Mr. McGowan drew the
Captain into his study. A cheery fire was
crackling in the fire-back. The minister
placed a chair before the grate and slid another
near. For some time the two men sat
looking into the fire. As Mr. McGowan
tossed in another stick of wood, he turned toward
the seaman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not know that you had a brother by
the name of Adoniah,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t often I make mention of him. I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span>
wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t over fond of him. He didn&rsquo;t treat
Clemmie fair. Then, he wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t nothing but a
half-brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me his last name was Phillips?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sartin was.... What was that you
said, Mack?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t speak. I was just thinking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d a heap sight rather you&rsquo;d speak out
loud than grunt like that. What in tarnation
is the matter with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you can throw any light on this man
Phillips, I wish you&rsquo;d do it. I&rsquo;ve heard his
name mentioned twice, by two different people,
with quite different effects.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by me throwing light
on him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me about him, all you know, good
and bad. What does Miss Pipkin know
about him? Where is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heave to, there, Mack! One at a time.
I don&rsquo;t know if Clemmie has any idea where
he is now. She was purty thick with him
once, and heerd from him once or twice after
he went off to sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was in love with him?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s putting it purty tame. I cal&rsquo;late&ndash;&ndash;Say,
has she been speaking to you
about him?&rdquo; asked the seaman eagerly.</p>
<p>The minister nodded. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m breaking a
promise to her by talking with you about it,
but&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Breaking a promise you made to Clemmie?
How&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She made me promise to say nothing to
you. But I must. This thing is getting too
interesting for me to keep my hands off any
longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean she made you say that you&rsquo;d
not tell me that she was in love with Adoniah?
That&rsquo;s funny, ain&rsquo;t it? Why, I knew&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;
He broke off abruptly, a new light coming
into his tired eyes. He leaned forward and
whispered hoarsely: &ldquo;Mack, it ain&rsquo;t likely
she&rsquo;s in love with&ndash;&ndash;well,&ndash;&ndash;with any other feller,
is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With me, for example,&rdquo; broke in the seaman.
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think maybe that was the
reason she made you give that promise, do
you?&rdquo; The Captain made no effort to hide
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span>
his eagerness. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind telling you that
I love Clemmie. I loved her long afore Adoniah
come along and sp&rsquo;iled it. He was
smarter than me, and went to school. He
was real bright and handsome. It wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t
that Clemmie loved him, but she didn&rsquo;t know
the difference. And I know right well he
didn&rsquo;t love her. He had took a spite against
me because I was left the home place, and he
took it out on me by stealing my girl. You
don&rsquo;t s&rsquo;pose she sees now that he didn&rsquo;t really
care&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; He slowly settled back into his
chair, and shook his head. &ldquo;I cal&rsquo;late that
ain&rsquo;t possible. You heerd what she said about
his sacred memory this morning. Good Lord!
Why won&rsquo;t she ever forget!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She may some day, Cap&rsquo;n. No man can
predict to-day what a woman may do to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The most of &rsquo;em are that way, but Clemmie&rsquo;s
different from the common run. I
know I&rsquo;m an old fool for wishing it, but it
ain&rsquo;t easy to give up the woman you love,
even after long years of her saying no to
you.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, Cap&rsquo;n. It isn&rsquo;t easy to
give up the woman you love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The minister gave the fire a vigorous poke,
sending a thick shower of sparks up the chimney.
The seaman glanced at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you the slightest idea where your
brother is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. I ain&rsquo;t heerd from him for more
than twenty years, and then it wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t direct.
He left because he was &rsquo;feared Clemmie was
going to make him marry her, and he knew if
he took to sailing the seas she&rsquo;d never foller
him. Damn him! He didn&rsquo;t treat her
square. That&rsquo;s why I don&rsquo;t have much use
for him. If he&rsquo;d told her out and out that he
wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t going to marry her, I&rsquo;d forgive him.
But&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did Mr. Fox know this half-brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About as well as he knew the rest of us
about town. He always was sort of h&rsquo;ity-t&rsquo;ity,
Jim was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he know him better after they left
Little River?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mack, I ain&rsquo;t got your tack, yet. Mind
telling me where you&rsquo;re heading?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;You asked me once if anything out of the
ordinary took place that night I dined at the
Fox home. Do you remember?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I rec&rsquo;lect I did ask you something
like that. But&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may also recall that you suggested
that what happened to Mr. Fox took place in
his head instead of in his heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I said that, too. But, Mack&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just wait, and I&rsquo;ll tell you what this is all
about. I had mentioned to Harold that I
was born in Australia&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mack!&rdquo; The Captain was out of his
chair in one bound. &ldquo;You born in Australia?
Why in tarnation didn&rsquo;t you ever tell
me that afore?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The minister looked puzzled. &ldquo;My announcement
had a similar effect on the
Elder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on, Mack. Don&rsquo;t mind me. I&rsquo;m a
mite narvous. All unstrung, I cal&rsquo;late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I said I had just mentioned that fact
to Harold, and the conversation naturally
turned back to the days of the early traders
who went to that country. Harold then told
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span>
his father that the law firm, of which he has
recently been made a junior member, had put
him on a case which necessitated his going
over to Australia. It seems that they had
been trying to clear it up for a long time.
The case came from Sydney, and had been
referred to him because he had once spent
some time over there. It was when he mentioned
the name of the client that Mr. Fox
nearly fainted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. McGowan gave the fire another vigorous
poke before continuing. The Captain
slid to the edge of his chair, holding on to the
sides.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know of all the movements
of Mr. Fox after he left here?&rdquo; came the
disappointing question from near the fireplace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t. But you was speaking of
the case from Sydney, Mack. Who was the
feller whose name hit Jim so hard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was Mr. Fox a sailor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lordie!&rdquo; ejaculated the Captain. &ldquo;Jim
Fox a sailor? Why, he couldn&rsquo;t sail a tub in
a flooded cellar.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;You mean he never crossed the ocean as a
trader?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He done that, I cal&rsquo;late, but as far as him
being a sailor&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; He sniffed a contemptuous
conclusion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many years ago was it that he followed
the seas?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t able to say, exactly, but it wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t
long after Adoniah left home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cap&rsquo;n Pott, Mr. Fox knew your half-brother
after they had both left this country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just by putting two and two together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The seaman took the yellow bit of paper
from his pocket, and in his excitement crumpled
it into a wad. &ldquo;But Adoniah went to
Australia, and Jim says he was in Africa,&rdquo; he
said, testing out the other&rsquo;s fund of information.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know all about that story, but I don&rsquo;t
believe one word of it. Mr. Fox did not make
his money in Africa, and he knew your half-brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s all this got to do with that there
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span>
client Harold spoke of the last night you ate
up there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything. The man he mentioned was
a trader in Sydney. He had married an only
daughter of an older trader, and then something
happened. The younger man disappeared
very suddenly. The old trader
searched for years, but in vain. Recently, he
died, leaving a large estate. His wife has
taken up the search for the lost daughter. It
was the name of the old trader&rsquo;s son-in-law
that crumpled up Mr. Fox like an autumn
leaf. The young trader&rsquo;s name was Adoniah
Phillips.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though he had been anticipating this, the
Captain fell back into his chair and stared
blankly at the minister. &ldquo;But why did he
act like the devil toward you, Mack? That&rsquo;s
what I want to know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. That is the thing that
puzzles me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What more do you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Harold said that Mr. Phillips came over
to this country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Captain again sprang from his chair as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span>
though hurled out by a strong spring. Mr.
McGowan rose to face him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My brother in America? Mack, it&rsquo;s a lie!
He&rsquo;d have looked me up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he had reasons for not wishing
you to know about him. He may have been
an outlaw.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The minister then asked abruptly, &ldquo;What
connection was there between him and Mr.
Fox? That is the thing we must find out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Captain was trembling. &ldquo;Have you
seen Harold since he come back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet. But I intend to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No you don&rsquo;t! For God&rsquo;s sake, boy,
don&rsquo;t do it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I must. I want to help you and
Miss Pipkin. Then, for some unknown reason,
I seem to be a part of all this mystery,
and I intend to ferret it out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mack, please don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it because you fear disgrace to your
family name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it!&rdquo; shouted the seaman, seizing
the minister by the arms with a crushing grip.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you the hull miserable yarn some
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span>
day, when I get to the bottom of it. But
keep your hands off now! Them&rsquo;s orders!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if I break them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, by the Lord Harry, I&rsquo;ll break&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;
The Captain stopped abruptly. &ldquo;Mack,
what be you doing in Little River?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Pipkin had been disturbed by the
noise, and now opened the study door. She
looked alarmed. The swarthy face of the
Captain was a sickly green where the white
reflected through the deep tan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of all things!&rdquo; exclaimed the housekeeper.
&ldquo;I s&rsquo;pose I should pity the two of
you if you feel the way you look. But, for
the lan&rsquo; sakes, Josiah, let go the minister&rsquo;s
arms this very minute. You&rsquo;re crushing
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Captain&rsquo;s hands relaxed and fell
limply to his sides. The tense muscles of his
face eased into a silly grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We was having a friendly little argument,
hey, Mack?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The minister assented.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, I&rsquo;d hate to see you in a real fight.
Things must be going to your head, Josiah.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a fact, Clemmie, they be, but
they&rsquo;re clearing it up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You need some of that liniment. Your
worrying has put your stomach out. I&rsquo;ll fix
up a dose for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No you won&rsquo;t neither. It ain&rsquo;t liniment
I want, it&rsquo;s something for the outside.&rdquo; He
started for his hat and coat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Josiah! You&rsquo;re clean off in your head,
going out a night like this! It&rsquo;s raining pitchforks,
and is past ten o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you worry, Clemmie. I ain&rsquo;t crazy.
I&rsquo;ve just got back what little sense I was born
with. I&rsquo;m sailing my <i>Jennie P.</i> to the city.
Good-bye.&rdquo; Before she could enter any protest,
he stooped and kissed her.</p>
<p>Miss Pipkin stood as one paralyzed while
the Captain snatched his rubber hat from the
nail behind the kitchen door, and slipped into
his slicker. He was out of the house before
the coat was fastened about his neck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, ain&rsquo;t that a caution to saints! And
us a-standing here and not trying to stop him.
He&rsquo;s gone plumb off in his head!&rdquo; lamented
the housekeeper, dropping limply into a chair.
&ldquo;What ever shall I do, Mr. McGowan? I
know he&rsquo;s coming down with that terrible fever
again. I know it! I know it!&rdquo; She
wept bitterly. &ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t been no one
so kind to me, and that cares for me like
him! And I ain&rsquo;t never give him any
chance!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you really care for the Captain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She straightened, and dabbed her apron
into the corners of her eyes, attempting at the
same time to marshal a legion of denials.
But the legion refused to be marshaled. She
gave up, and admitted that she did care for
Captain Josiah, very much.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, he&rsquo;ll come back, have no fear. A
twenty-mule team couldn&rsquo;t keep him away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What good will it be if he does come back,
if he ain&rsquo;t got his senses?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In my opinion he was never more sane
than he is to-night. He has not taken leave
of his senses; he is not a man so easily dethroned.
He has merely taken a leave of absence
from town, and all his five senses have
gone with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After Miss Pipkin had gone to her room
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span>
somewhat comforted, Mr. McGowan spied
the yellow piece of paper which the Captain
had dropped. He stooped down, picked it
up, smoothed the crumpled page, and began
to read. His eyes widened with each additional
line.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Jim and I are going into partnership over
here in Sydney. It isn&rsquo;t just what I&rsquo;d like,
but there are certain advantages. He is a
keen fellow, and I&rsquo;ll have to watch him pretty
close. There is an older man who has taken
us into his firm, so Jim can&rsquo;t have his own
way. There is loads of money here, and I
mean to get my share of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jim and I are both fighting for the same
girl. She is the daughter of the old man who
heads up the firm. May the best man win,
providing I&rsquo;m the best man. I&rsquo;ll give him
some run for his money, anyway. I think
I&rsquo;m on the inside track for the present.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;d better not say anything
about Jim being over here. He isn&rsquo;t using
his own name, and says he wants it kept a
dead secret. Just what his game is, I don&rsquo;t
know. But there are lots just like him who
are hiding behind assumed names.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m too harum-scarum a sailor for a quiet
home-loving woman like you, so just forget
me. Be good to&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span></div>
<p>Here the page ended, and the remainder of
the letter was in Miss Pipkin&rsquo;s trunk.</p>
<p>Before he had finished reading, the chug-chug
from the Captain&rsquo;s power-boat floated
in from the harbor, and the minister longed to
be with him.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
</div>
<p>Elizabeth Fox was sitting alone in her
room when the familiar chug from the exhaust
of the <i>Jennie P.</i> fell on her ears. She raised
her window-curtain, and watched the dim
lights move out of the harbor in the direction
of the Sound. An unreasoning fear seized
her, and it steadily grew more and more acute
as the exhaust from the engine exploded less
and less distinctly. As the lights went out of
view into the rain-soaked night, resentment
replaced fear. The minister had doubtless
heard of the plans that were being laid by Sim
Hicks for his forceful ejection from Little
River, and rather than face further trouble
was slinking away like a coward under cover
of night and storm.</p>
<p>Her better judgment soon began to form
excuses for his action. The Athletic Club,
thoroughly reorganized, had been placed under
good leadership, and Mr. McGowan
doubtless thought that the members could get
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span>
on without his further aid. In all probability,
he feared that his presence might interfere
with the promised consummation of fellowship
between the club and the church, and
was leaving quietly so another man less aggressive
than he might accomplish the thing
he had so well begun. Had he remained, he
would have been compelled to fight his way
through by brute force. He had been forsaken
by all those who should have stood by
him. He was not a coward! He was taking
the most difficult course. His going was the
most heroic act of all.</p>
<p>Why had every man&rsquo;s hand been against
him? Why had her father not so much as
lifted a finger to stay the persecutors? She
drew in her lip between her teeth, and mercilessly
bit the pretty Cupid&rsquo;s arch. She
kicked her foot against a stool till the piece of
furniture lay beyond reach of her toe. Her
father had not made a single effort to prevent
one action of those who had set themselves
against the minister. Instead, he had aided
them, and in many instances had even led in
the opposition against the young man.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span></div>
<p>One thought at length inhibited all others.
She drew back from the window, and sinking
into a deep chair, covered her face with her
arm. Mack McGowan had gone out of her
life! Suddenly, she knew that she loved him,
loved him as passionately as he had declared
his love for her. Why had she been unable to
understand him that night on the beach?
Had she really tried? She classed herself with
all the others who had been so blind as to force
this man to leave their village.</p>
<p>She jerked the pins from her hair, letting
the fair mass fall over her shoulders. The
stand she had taken had been because of the
attitude of her father. He had no right to
come between her and the man she loved.
Why had he done it? Her fingers paused in
the act of delving for a buried hairpin, and
her arm fell limply over the wing of the chair.
A vision of her father&rsquo;s face had come before
her, startling her imagination. She saw him
again as she had seen him that night when
Harold had announced his intended trip to
Australia. She recalled his ghostly features
on the night of Harold&rsquo;s return from abroad.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span>
Could there be some unknown reason for her
father&rsquo;s actions against the young minister?
And did that reason justify his action?</p>
<p>Her conjectures were cut short by the
sound of footfalls on the stair. The tread
was heavy, as though the climber were dragging
himself up by main force. On the top
landing he halted, and turned toward her
door.</p>
<p>What caprices emotion plays with judgment!
One moment judgment may map out
a course as clear as the noonday, and the next
moment emotion may lead judgment into a
blind alley. Thus did the emotions of Elizabeth
suddenly halt her judgment, leaving all
her reason deaf, dumb, and blind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beth, are you asleep?&rdquo; whispered a tired,
husky voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Father. I haven&rsquo;t retired yet.
Come in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She blindly felt that her father had need of
her, and although she could not understand
the meaning of the battle he had been called
upon to general, she must give him her aid.</p>
<p>Mr. Fox entered and felt his way across the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span>
dark room. He found a chair and dropped
into it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re in the dark, dear,&rdquo; he observed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Father. I&rsquo;ve been thinking here
since twilight. Lights always interfere with
my thoughts, and so I did not turn them
on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, my dear, how long you have been
sitting like this! It is now nearly eleven
o&rsquo;clock. Your thoughts must have been
pretty active.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had no idea it was that late!&rdquo; she exclaimed.
&ldquo;I have been thinking a great
deal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stirred uneasily. Since the Captain&rsquo;s
visit the Elder had been on the verge of collapse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty bad storm,&rdquo; he commented, and
his voice trembled.</p>
<p>Elizabeth reached out into the darkness and
took his hand. As she pressed it to her lips
she felt it shake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Beth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you well, Father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not very. But it is nothing serious. At
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span>
least, the doctor so assures me. I presume he
ought to know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you go to the city and consult
a specialist? These country doctors may not
understand how to diagnose your case fully.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the specialists in Christendom couldn&rsquo;t
help me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t grow alarmed,&rdquo; he said, with a
short nervous laugh. &ldquo;The only thing any
doctor ever removes from his patient is what
is worth the doctor&rsquo;s while. Present day
physicians get away with a lot that is no credit
to their profession. The main thing that interests
them is not the disease, but the sufferer&rsquo;s
pocketbook. If they can remove the
latter, they will keep coaxing the former
along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose it is the spirit of the age to want
to get all the money one can. Others, besides
doctors, do that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Yes. There are still others who are
grossly misjudged simply because they have
money, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course there are. But let&rsquo;s forget
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span>
both those classes and talk about you. Please,
tell me all about your troubles. It hurts me
to see you suffering so, and I want to help
you. I&rsquo;ll try very hard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you everything, Beth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Yes, you can. I&rsquo;ll be your doctor,
and I&rsquo;ll promise not to remove more of your
money than is absolutely necessary for a new
frock. Try me this once, and see how well
I&rsquo;ll prescribe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Money is not troubling me, and I&rsquo;ll see
that you get all the new frocks you wish. But
I fear you would not understand if I should
tell you all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall try most awfully hard, Father.
You have told me lots of times that for a girl
I have excellent ideas about business dealings.
Please, tell me. It will at least help you to
unburden your mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I have told you already that what is
troubling me has nothing whatever to do with
business. I tried to talk with you the other
evening, and you failed to understand. We
must not quarrel again. That is harder for
me to bear than all else.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I am very sorry for that, Daddy. I fear
I lost my head. I am ashamed of the way I
acted, and of what I said. Will you not forgive
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, my dear. We were both pretty severe.
We are living too much on our nerves
of late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, that the past is cleared up, tell me
what is troubling you to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You say you have been sitting here for a
long while?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since twilight. It didn&rsquo;t seem so long,
though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you see anything strange, or hear
anything familiar?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw Uncle Josiah&rsquo;s boat leave the harbor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t it strike you as being rather odd
that he should be going out this time of night,
and in such a storm? He went out last night,
too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it did seem very strange to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beth?&rdquo; The Elder&rsquo;s voice wavered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, Father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know I&rsquo;ve no right to worry you like
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span>
this, but I don&rsquo;t stand reverses like I once
did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reverses! You told me it wasn&rsquo;t money!
And, anyway, what does Uncle Josiah&rsquo;s action
have to do with your reverses?&rdquo; She
switched on the light at her desk. When she
saw her father&rsquo;s face she gave a little cry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have told you the truth, Beth. It isn&rsquo;t
money. I wish to God it were nothing more
than that! There are reverses far harder to
bear than financial ones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her father appeared older than she had
ever seen him. Dejection showed through
every line of his haggard face. The side-whiskers,
which to his daughter&rsquo;s mind he had
worn with great distinction, now gave to his
worn features a grotesque expression.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel pretty well worn out to-night, my
dear,&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;weariness was in every word he uttered,&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;and
as if I need some one to lean on.
If I did not need you to help me, I should
not be bothering you at this hour of the
night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl drew before her father&rsquo;s chair the
footstool which earlier in the evening she had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span>
kicked into a far corner. She sat at his knee,
and, taking his hand in hers, pressed it against
her cheek. For some time they sat thus in
silence. Her father broke in on the quietness
of the room with a peculiar question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Bible tells us that we should love our
enemies, doesn&rsquo;t it, Beth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Father, you have no enemies worth
worrying about! Why should you ask such a
question?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They may not be worth worrying about,
but as I said before I don&rsquo;t seem able to fight
off worry as I once could.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense! When all this blows over you
will see where you have been very foolish to
have worried in the least bit. You are not
strong, and everything appears worse than it
really is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about that, my dear. I&rsquo;m
not so certain, either, that my enemies are not
worth worrying about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course they&rsquo;re not. Just think how
all the people have honored you for what you
have done for Little River. Your gifts will
not be so quickly forgotten that a total
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span>
stranger can change the feeling of respect for
you among your lifelong friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m aware of all that, and I appreciate
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What has all this to do about Uncle Josiah&rsquo;s
leaving town?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m coming to that. Suppose one of
those you called my lifelong friends proved to
be just the opposite?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That can&rsquo;t be true about Uncle Josiah!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Public expressions of gratitude can never
atone for the knife which a supposedly close
friend drives into one&rsquo;s heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elizabeth unconsciously drew away. The
movement was slight, but her father noticed
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beth, Josiah has gone to the city to-night
for no good purpose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think he went alone?&rdquo; With a
savage leap the question got beyond the
bounds of her lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt it. Just what part the other will
play, I don&rsquo;t know. But of one thing I&rsquo;m
certain, Josiah is bent on ill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elizabeth felt that her old friend was being
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span>
weighed in the balances. She could not trust
her words to the emotion she felt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think you are in a position to understand
what I&rsquo;m trying to tell you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father,&rdquo; she said, speaking slowly that
she might not lose control of herself, &ldquo;if you
were not so serious about this, I should be
tempted to laugh at your little melodramatic
farce. It is the most ridiculous thing in all
the world for you to imagine that Uncle Josiah
would play double with us! He is too
good-hearted for even one evil suggestion to
get into his mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not want to tell you the fact, but I
fear I must. Of late he has been openly hostile
to every suggestion I have made. I presume
he thinks I should have secured a boat
for him. That may account for his action.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What dreadful thing has he done? I
can&rsquo;t imagine&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crookedness comes from the most unexpected
sources,&rdquo; cut in her father, curtly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But such a thing would not be unexpected
from Uncle Josiah, it would be impossible.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span></div>
<p>The Elder lowered his eyes to meet those
peering at him from the tangle of fair hair.
&ldquo;As I have already suggested, you might not
understand me. It seems that you are determined
not to understand. It would be very
hard for me to have another falling out with
my little girl. Maybe I should say nothing
further.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you are intending to say something
against Uncle Josiah, perhaps you had better
not say it. I&rsquo;m afraid I wouldn&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned from her father and tried to
gaze through the window. The beating
storm, and the light from within, made the
pane opaque. She stared against this till her
eyes ached.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beth!&rdquo; There was a note of command
in his tone.</p>
<p>She turned to face her father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come here,&rdquo; he ordered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle Josiah untrue to us!&rdquo; she said,
without moving from her place at the window.
&ldquo;I cannot believe it. There must be some
mistake.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;There is absolutely no mistake about it.
I should like to believe it more than you. I
have even tried to make myself believe that
my imagination was getting the better of me.
But he was up here only last night, and confirmed
all my fears.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle Josiah untrue! He could not be
after all you have done for him. You loaned
him money, and helped him fix up his place.
Why, Father,&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is the thing that makes it hurt so,&rdquo;
broke in the Elder. &ldquo;He seems ungrateful
for all I have done. I don&rsquo;t care half as much
for the praises of people inspired by a crowd
as I do for one kind word from an individual
whom I have helped.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some one has influenced Uncle Josiah, if
he has taken this attitude against you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have had the same fear. But even that
would not excuse him for cursing me and
threatening me with violence under my own
roof.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elizabeth looked doubtful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It amounts to that, my dear. The things
he said to me last night are too vulgar to repeat.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span>
He swore vengeance against me. I
am compelled to take a certain action against
him, and naturally he is not able to see&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father!&rdquo; cried the girl. &ldquo;Then, it is
you who are threatening to do something
against him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it seems to him on the face of the action
I must take. But at bottom it is an act
of true friendship. He does not know the
particulars, and I am in no position to explain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it you are going to do?&rdquo; she
asked, drawing farther into the corner near
the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must request that you ask me no questions.
You are not familiar enough with the
law to comprehend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her gaze was fixed on him, and the Elder
hitched sidewise in his chair, vainly trying to
avoid her eyes. Failing in this, he attempted
to meet her look squarely. His eyes shifted
unsteadily, and he looked above her head.
But the eyes of his child continued to bore
into his guilty soul.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you stare at me in that manner,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span>
Beth?&rdquo; he questioned, motioning her to his
side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; She gave no evidence
that she saw his effort to draw her near him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, stop glaring like that. How many
times have I told you that it is unladylike?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to take his place from him
because he cannot pay that loan!&rdquo; she whispered.
&ldquo;How can you be so cruel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Fox was left without excuse or reply.
When he spoke, his voice was harsh, and his
words were sharp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see, I have been unwise in telling you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t tell me, but I could not help
guessing the truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m doing it for his good, and unless you
believe me,&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For his good! You can&rsquo;t mean that!
You shall not stoop&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stoop!&rdquo; He caught up the word with a
hiss. But he soon controlled his anger, and
dropped his pale face into trembling hands.
&ldquo;God help me! They that hurt me are even
of my own household!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father, I don&rsquo;t want to hurt you. I&rsquo;m
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span>
not your enemy!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m only your
little Beth trying so hard to see why you must
do this terrible thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come to me,&rdquo; he begged.</p>
<p>She took her place on the footstool, and
took his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall try to tell you all about it, if you
will listen. I didn&rsquo;t intend to, but it is more
than I can bear to have my own daughter
question my honesty and integrity. Harold&rsquo;s
unjust insinuations are almost more than I
can bear. Now, if you&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say it, Father! I have not doubted
your word yet. I don&rsquo;t want to now. I
won&rsquo;t doubt you. Tell me all, and I&rsquo;ll try to
see this from your point of view.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You guessed rightly about what I have to
do. The mortgage on Josiah&rsquo;s place&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can certainly extend that, if only for
six months. You don&rsquo;t need the money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t interrupt me again, please. It&rsquo;s a
far more serious thing than the small loan I
made to Josiah to repair his place with. The
old homestead was willed to Josiah&rsquo;s half-brother,
providing he should outlive Josiah.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span>
Josiah knew nothing about that fact, and
when he was so informed by his friends years
ago, refused to listen to any of us. The half-brother
left the country rather than quarrel
with him over the estate. Later, this half-brother
was in serious financial trouble, and I
happened to come across him when he was in
dire need of money. Knowing of the will, I
loaned him all he needed, and took out a first
mortgage on his property. Owing to peculiar
circumstances, I put in a provision that there
was to be no foreclosure so long as the interest
was paid. I even went beyond the request
which the man made, by including another
clause which prevents me or my heirs from
foreclosing before the expiration of two years
after the last payment of interest. Have you
followed me closely?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, each year the interest has been paid
in full up to the last two. As long as it was
forthcoming I said nothing. I have not mentioned
a word of this transaction between the
half-brother and me, for I knew his hot temper
would get the better of him. He thinks the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span>
man was drowned at sea, and it is best that
he continue to think so. I have misled him
into the belief that I was foreclosing because
of the small loan I made last spring, and I
trusted to his usual secrecy and apparent
ignorance to say nothing about it to any one.
But from the arrogant manner he maintained
toward me last night I fear he has said more
than is good for him. And I have every reason
to think that the meddler is the minister.
I doubt not but that is the reason why he has
gone to the city to-night, and I don&rsquo;t think he
has gone alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When must that interest be paid?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before midday, Saturday. The other
loan does not come due for more than two
weeks, but the time was so near that I did not
think of Josiah questioning it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who has been paying the interest on the
other loan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know, but it has doubtless been
coming from some estate of the father-in-law
of Josiah&rsquo;s brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why was it dropped?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I cannot tell you. I should have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span>
done nothing even now had I not learned that
this half-brother has come into that estate
through the death of the wife&rsquo;s father. I have
every reason to believe that he could pay not
alone the interest, but the principal as well, if
he so desired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps this half-brother does not know
about the inheritance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is absurd. He does know, or should.
The fact is, he is an <a name='TC_9'></a><ins class="tnchg" title="Was &#34;outaw&#34;">outlaw</ins> and is hiding from
justice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why should you make Uncle Josiah
suffer for what his half-brother did?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is the very thing I am trying not to
do. Can&rsquo;t you see where it would place him if
I told him the truth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. But I see no reason why you can&rsquo;t
let things go on as they have, and forget the
unpaid interest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no power to do that. I put the
matter in the hands of my lawyers in order to
force the hidden rascal to take action.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it would be best to tell Uncle
Josiah all about it, and let him help you find
the one who should pay.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Such action would be senseless for two
reasons: it would give Josiah grief and pain,
and he would be unable to meet the obligation.
It was larger than what the place would
cover when first made, and with the deterioration
in the value of the property it now far
exceeds its worth. Then, there is the interest
for two years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you offer to buy the place,
even paying more than the mortgage calls
for? It would be a kindness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I made such an offer through my lawyer,
but Josiah refused.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, why not cancel it altogether?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would be very unbusiness-like,&rdquo; he
declared curtly. &ldquo;But even if I so desired,
it would be impossible now. I have permitted
my lawyers to use the foreclosure as a threat,
and I&rsquo;m duty bound to see it through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it is absolutely necessary to go through
with this, I don&rsquo;t see that it would make it
any more terrible if we should tell Uncle
Josiah the whole story. It would, at least,
save his thinking ill of us. Then, there is the
chance that he might suggest something.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287' name='page_287'></a>287</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Beth, I&rsquo;m bound by my word to say nothing.
That was the one promise I made to
Adoniah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Adoniah!&rdquo; exclaimed the girl, her eyes
growing wide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. I did not mean to speak his name,
but it can do no harm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&ndash;&ndash;that was the first name&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;Is
he the same man Harold is trying to find?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to say that he is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The one whose last name was Phillips?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. But why do you take such interest
in him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he is a brother of Uncle Josiah?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A half-brother,&rdquo; he replied, showing that
he was becoming nettled.</p>
<p>Elizabeth rose from her stool, and crossed
over to the door that led into the hall. She
did not seem to sense just what she was doing
till her hand touched the cold knob. With
a start, as though wakened from a bad dream,
she turned about and faced her father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father,&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;her breath came in short
gasps,&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;you have no right to keep your
word to such a man as you say this Phillips
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span>
person is. There is but one thing for us to
do: go at once to Uncle Josiah. I&rsquo;m certain
he can get enough money to pay the interest,
if that is what you want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Beth, I cannot do that. My business
honor is at stake, and I must permit the
law to take its course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may be right about the legal part.
But how about the moral side? Is there not
something at stake there, too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does seem a moral injustice, but I cannot
help that. It is hard, for Josiah will see
only the moral side of it, and the people of
the village will think it unjust. Josiah may
find out the facts, that is, enough of them to
prove to his mind that I can&rsquo;t foreclose on his
property because of the little loan. What
more he may discover, I cannot even guess.
It will depend somewhat on the lawyer who
advises him. But no matter what he discovers,
my conscience will be clear in that I did
not break faith with his renegade brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What right have you to keep faith with
him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My little Beth, please do not question
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289' name='page_289'></a>289</span>
my action,&rdquo; he entreated. &ldquo;It will all be
clear to you some day. I&rsquo;m willing to wait
for my vindication, but I must know that my
little girl trusts her daddy to do what is right.
If you don&rsquo;t, it will kill me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was such deep pathos in his voice
that she recrossed the room. She laid her
hand on the arm of her father&rsquo;s chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After all, Father, I am only a girl, and
know very little of law and business. Forgive
me if I have hurt you. I don&rsquo;t see why
you feel as you do about carrying this thing
through at so great a sacrifice of lifelong
friendships. But I believe that you must be
doing the best you can as you see your duty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can hope for no more than that, my
dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly she shook the hair from her shining
eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you what I&rsquo;m going to do!&rdquo; she
cried. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to Uncle Josiah just as
soon as he gets back, and tell him as much as
I think he ought to know. May I?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290' name='page_290'></a>290</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, if you wish. I&rsquo;ll trust to your
discretion. He will listen to you. I think
you know what must not be said, from our
conversation this evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it!&rdquo; she exclaimed eagerly, and
stooped above the chair to kiss her father&rsquo;s
forehead. &ldquo;Now, you go right to bed. That
is my first remedy. My second is like unto it:
don&rsquo;t do one single bit of worrying. Remember!
Good night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Elder rose and smiled benignly on his
daughter. At the door he paused, and turned
back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beth, this may affect the minister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Affect the minister? Affect Mr. McGowan?
How can it do that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has doubtless urged Josiah to take
this rash step to consult a lawyer, and when
all the facts come out he may be forced to
leave Little River. As you know, his popularity
is quite dubious as matters stand at
present.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I hardly see&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll say nothing more about that.
Good night, my dear.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291' name='page_291'></a>291</span></div>
<p>Her door closed, and her father crossed the
hall. She was no sooner alone than a rush
of unbidden thoughts and emotions swept
over her, carrying all her promises like chaff
before a hurricane. While her father had been
in the room she had thought herself quite determined
to take the hard step of explaining
to Uncle Josiah just enough to remove the
blame from the one she loved to the half-brother.
But now that the Elder had gone
her will to explain seemed gone, too. Again
he rose before her imagination, a white trembling
figure. She heard Harold speak the
name of Adoniah Phillips, and saw her father
stagger from the table. Had these two things
been a mere coincidence? Doubts began to
rise. Why must the mortgage be foreclosed
on Uncle Josiah&rsquo;s place? Why had her father
acted so on the evening when Harold had
spoken his client&rsquo;s name? Had her father
told her all? Why should all this involve the
minister, even though he had advised the Captain
to seek the counsel of a lawyer?</p>
<p>Long into the night she puzzled her brain
in seeking for answers to her many questions.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292' name='page_292'></a>292</span>
Of one thing she felt sure, Mr. McGowan
would not leave Little River. Just between
waking and sleeping she at length recalled
the words of love which he had spoken to her
on the beach, spoken as she had never heard
them before, and they carried her along
dreamy paths into a happy visionary future.</p>

</td></tr></table>
<p>Certainly, no audience would be moved to
tears, either by the quality of the voice, or
by the ditty that was thus rendered. And yet,
there was a blue-eyed, fair-haired girl, seated
on the rocks below her father&rsquo;s place, whose
eyes filled with tears as she listened. Elizabeth
thought she was prepared to fulfill the
promise made to her father three days ago,
but, now that the opportunity was upon her,
she felt her resolution slipping away. She
loved her dear old friend as never in all her
life.</p>
<p>The singer rounded a projection of sandy
beach just beyond the rock-pile where the girl
was sitting. He was hurrying up the shore in
the direction of his home, his dejected figure
revealing his utter loneliness, despite the
lightness of his song. His brow was puckered,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294' name='page_294'></a>294</span>
more with furrows of perplexity than
with lines of anger, as he made his way with
labored difficulty up the steep incline from the
beach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Uncle Josiah!&rdquo; involuntarily cried
the girl as she caught a glimpse of the haggard
face.</p>
<p>The old man stopped, turned about, and
looked up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, ain&rsquo;t this surprising good luck to
find you here!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;I was just
thinking about you, Beth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do your thoughts of me always make you
sing like that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That there song ain&rsquo;t got much music,
and I cal&rsquo;late it don&rsquo;t improve to speak of
with my voice,&rdquo; he answered, his swarthy face
breaking into a broad smile. &ldquo;It must sound
funny for an old fish like me to be serenading
a young lady like you. Glad you liked the entertainment,
Beth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say I liked it. It made me feel
very bad,&rdquo; she said, loosening a stone with
the point of her shoe and sending it rolling to
the water&rsquo;s edge.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295' name='page_295'></a>295</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t just rec&rsquo;lect that you spoke
favorable on that p&rsquo;int. I honest didn&rsquo;t know
you was about else I&rsquo;d tried something more
fitting to the occasion. Fact is, Beth, I was
singing to keep my spirits up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should be happier than you look,
then, for your singing is better than a vaudeville
show.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t none too partic&rsquo;lar about classing
me, be you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Singing isn&rsquo;t in your line, and if I were
you I&rsquo;d not try it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beth, what&rsquo;s wrong? You don&rsquo;t seem
real glad to see me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, I&rsquo;m glad to see you, my dear
old sailor Uncle,&rdquo; she said, rising and putting
her arms about his neck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, Beth.&rdquo; He choked out the
words, for as he looked down he saw the sign
of tears in her eyes. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been cruising
round nigh onto three days, and that&rsquo;s a purty
long spell for the land-lubber I&rsquo;m getting to
be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your return was as sudden as your departure,
wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296' name='page_296'></a>296</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Sudden? What do you mean by that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what I say. I was looking for the
<i>Jennie P.</i> to come into the harbor. Perhaps
she came as she went, like the ships that pass
in the night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see me go out, did you, Beth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She nodded. &ldquo;But I did not see you return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did sort of sneak out. What did you
think of me for doing a thing like that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think very highly of you, if you
want the honest truth,&rdquo; she declared, releasing
her arms from about his neck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t mad, are you, Beth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think I have a perfect right to
get angry? It was the first time you ever left
home without telling me good-bye. Should I
like that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never thought of that. But this here
cruise was like the proposing to the old maid:
unexpected-like. For that reason I wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t prepared
for saying good-byes.&rdquo; His eyes clouded
as he slowly continued, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a fact,
I never went off afore without telling you
good-bye. I don&rsquo;t&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297' name='page_297'></a>297</span></div>
<p>He stopped and looked down at the girl.
She was no longer the child who had clung to
him on the eve of departures for long cruises,
asking, &ldquo;Take me &rsquo;long, Unca Josi?&rdquo; She
had grown to womanhood! He wondered
that the thought had not occurred to him before.
And yet, as he continued to gaze, he
saw the eager child staring up into his face
from the big eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cal&rsquo;late I ain&rsquo;t got no right to expect
them partings no more,&rdquo; he faltered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Uncle Josiah Pott! I don&rsquo;t like
that one little bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You seem so growed up, Beth, and I
cal&rsquo;late you&rsquo;re getting too big&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For you to love me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; he said vehemently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, just what do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; He drew awkwardly
back as she approached him, and fumbled his
hat till it fell from his fingers. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re getting
to be quite a woman,&rdquo; he observed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;re getting very foolish! Now,
you kiss me before I get angry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stooped, kissed her hastily, and wiped
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298' name='page_298'></a>298</span>
his lips with the back of his coat-sleeve. He
picked up his hat, and began to rub it vigorously
with his finger-tips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If ever you talk like that again I&rsquo;ll punish
you by never giving you another kiss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t got no right to expect it, anyway,
Beth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle Josiah, don&rsquo;t let me hear that
again. I want to hear all about your voyage,&rdquo;
she demanded as she settled herself on the
rocks, and motioned him near her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t none, that is, none to speak
of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! But there was, and it must have
been the most mysterious of all. You went in
the night, and you came in the night. Did you
do all your trading in the night, too, slipping
about through the streets in some unknown
country with moccasins on your feet, like you
once told me about the Chinese?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She laughed, but the Captain did not catch
the restrained note and manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, now! That&rsquo;s more like it!&rdquo; he declared,
joining in with a cracked laugh. &ldquo;It
seemed afore like I was talking to a young
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299' name='page_299'></a>299</span>
lady I&rsquo;d never seen. Feel more like I&rsquo;d got
back home with you laughing like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t been indulging much since you
went away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But tell me about your trip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You was right on most p&rsquo;ints, excepting I
didn&rsquo;t cruise back in the night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then how did you slip into town so
quietly and unseen? I&rsquo;ve been sitting on
these cold stones for two days looking for
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I come back by railroad, and just now
was walking over from the station.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where did you leave the <i>Jennie P.</i>?
Why didn&rsquo;t you come back with her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I run her into dry-dock down to the city
for repairs,&rdquo; he said quietly.</p>
<p>The girl noticed a slight catch in his voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you did all your own repairing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do when there ain&rsquo;t nothing bad
wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You sailed the <i>Jennie P.</i> all the way into
the city and left it there?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300' name='page_300'></a>300</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Something went wrong with the engine,
and I didn&rsquo;t have no time to tinker with her
afore I had to come back. Them there gas
engines is worse than a team of mules when
they get to bucking and balking. They&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain Pott! Tell me the truth. Why
did you leave your boat in the city docks?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the reason I told you.&rdquo; He was
looking away from her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at me, Uncle Josiah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t just now, Beth. I&rsquo;m watching&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, please tell me all about it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t nothing more to tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did not leave the <i>Jennie P.</i> in dry-dock
for repairs!&rdquo; she cried with apprehension.</p>
<p>He did not reply, but tightly gripped the
hand which had been slipped into his.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me, please!&rdquo; she implored. &ldquo;You
said a little while ago that you were singing
to keep up your spirits. Something dreadful
has happened. Did you wreck your boat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey? Me wreck the <i>Jennie P.</i>? I tell
you honest, Beth, there ain&rsquo;t nothing&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_301' name='page_301'></a>301</span></div>
<p>Elizabeth lifted her hand and turned his
face toward her. He looked down and gave
up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t no use pretending to you. I
sold her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You sold the <i>Jennie P.</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sold the <i>Jennie P.</i>,&rdquo; he repeated slowly,
as though it were hard for him to comprehend
that fact. &ldquo;You see, I didn&rsquo;t have no more
real need for her, and &rsquo;twas kind of expensive
to keep her afloat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; exclaimed the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a mite expensive, honest, Beth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle Josiah! Why didn&rsquo;t you come to
me if you were in need of money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I owe your father more now than I&rsquo;d
otter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I love you so!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The big shoulders gave a decided heave.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s wuth more to me than all the money
in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, why didn&rsquo;t you come to me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think of doing that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Uncle Josiah!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I sold my boat. There wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t no
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_302' name='page_302'></a>302</span>
wonder I was singing, was there?&rdquo; he asked,
passing his hand across his face as if to clear
his vision. &ldquo;I cal&rsquo;late that song wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t much
like music to you, but I just naturally had
to do something to keep my feelings afloat,
didn&rsquo;t I, Beth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sold her,&rdquo; he said, speaking as though
his thoughts were coming by way of his
tongue. &ldquo;It wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t easy. Just like parting
with an old friend. It sort of pulled on me.
Odd, ain&rsquo;t it, how an old boat like that can
get a hold on a feller?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it is not odd. Some of the happiest
moments of my life were spent on board the
<i>Jennie P.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you honest feel that way about her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m mighty glad, Beth,&rdquo; he said, his eyes
gleaming with pride. &ldquo;She sartin was a
worthy craft.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who bought your boat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Feller by the name of Peters, who runs a
fish business down on East River near Brooklyn
bridge. I knew him years ago. His
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_303' name='page_303'></a>303</span>
wife&rsquo;s name is Jennie, and I named my boat
after her &rsquo;cause he was the first man to help
me sail her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did you go to him without first telling
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t no time to tell no one.
You&rsquo;d not likely&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you men! You treat us women as if
we were numskulls. If you had given me the
slightest idea that you intended to sell I
should have put in my bid along with others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean you would have bought my
<i>Jennie P.</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not, pray tell? Haven&rsquo;t I as much
right to own a boat as any man you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do believe you&rsquo;d have bought her, sartin
as death!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I should. If&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; Her eyes
suddenly widened. &ldquo;Why did you sell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Same as I said afore, I didn&rsquo;t have no
need of her, and she was getting expensive to
keep up.&rdquo; His face darkened, and an expression
of pain shot through the shadows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You said you were not going to pretend
to me. Tell me the real reason.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_304' name='page_304'></a>304</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In other words, that is the secret of your
mysterious trip to the city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s my secret.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear old Uncle!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I
know your secret! You sold your boat to get
money with which to pay Father. You&rsquo;ve
sold your one little luxury to pay a debt you
can never pay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re mistook. I can pay your father
every cent I got from him to overhaul my
place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that isn&rsquo;t all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought I could tell you all about it, but
I can&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean you&rsquo;ve something you
want to say to me, Beth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t! I can&rsquo;t! It is so&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She broke down and cried without restraint.
The old seaman put his arm about
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There! There! Don&rsquo;t cry like that.
She ain&rsquo;t wuth it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you are!&rdquo; she sobbed.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_305' name='page_305'></a>305</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;All that there flood sartinly ain&rsquo;t for an
old feller like me! Tut! Tut! I sartinly ain&rsquo;t
wuth it. I&rsquo;m nothing but a leaky old ark
what had otter been towed in long ago, safe
and high to some dry-dock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle Josiah, you are the only uncle I&rsquo;ve
ever had. I love you next to my father.
You are the only man who has ever understood
me. I have many times come to you
before going to my own father. And, now,
that you are in trouble, and I might have
helped you&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tush. Tush. Don&rsquo;t cry over an old salt
like me. I tell you I ain&rsquo;t wuth it, not one
precious drop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you only knew!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe I ain&rsquo;t so deep in the fog as you
think. I took another trip while I was in the
city to see a lawyer, and I found out some
mighty interesting things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he couldn&rsquo;t tell you everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beth, is there something you&rsquo;d otter tell
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is&ndash;&ndash;there was&ndash;&ndash;but I guess&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;Did
you see a good lawyer?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_306' name='page_306'></a>306</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;The best I could find.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, why did you sacrifice your boat?
It was so needless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had to have that much money right off,
and there wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t no time to look about. I
didn&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;d take it like this or I&rsquo;d sartin
never done it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you had only come to me I could have
let you have that much without you having to
sell your boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would have been a mite queer to borrow
from you to pay your dad, wouldn&rsquo;t
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does that matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing, much.... But you was
going to tell me something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She lifted her tear-stained face, and slowly
shook her head. &ldquo;Not now. I might cry
again, and I&rsquo;ve been silly enough for one
day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t been silly, not one mite. I had
no right to make you cry by telling you
things that don&rsquo;t consarn you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, you should have told me, and it
does concern, far more than you think,&rdquo; she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_307' name='page_307'></a>307</span>
replied, drying her eyes and cheeks. &ldquo;I
know I must look frightful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t look nothing of the sort. You
couldn&rsquo;t if you tried to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you be home to-night, Uncle
Josiah?&rdquo; she asked, looking at her wrist-watch.
It was half-past ten o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cal&rsquo;late to be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I come to see you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a funny question. I should say
you can come. Clemmie will be real glad to
see you, and so will the minister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m coming to see you,&rdquo; she said, coloring.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going home now. Good-bye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She hurriedly kissed him, and before he had
time to speak she was half-way up the hill.
At the rear gate she waved, then disappeared
behind the mass of shrubbery that lined her
father&rsquo;s place.</p>
<p>Ten minutes later the Captain heard the
roar of the open exhaust from the girl&rsquo;s
motor. Like a red streak the car shot down
the hill of the Fox estate and into County
Road. The Captain gasped as he watched a
cloud of dust engulf the flying car.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
</div>
<p>All those who saw the flying car stood
and stared after it. Hank Simpson, who was
on his way over from the Little River railroad
station with a load of merchandise, heard
the roar, and sprang from his wagon-seat.
He ran to his horses&rsquo; heads. But no sooner
had he seized the bits of the frightened animals
than he let go. He recognized the girl
who sped past him. He clambered back into
his wagon and whipped his team into a dead
run. He drew rein on the racing horses before
a group of gaping men in front of the
general store.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you see anything down yon way,
Hank?&rdquo; asked Jud Johnson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See!&rdquo; exclaimed Hank, rubbing the dust
from his eyes. &ldquo;See! Good God! Boys,
that damn thing was running away! Hear
me? It was running like hell! What are you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_309' name='page_309'></a>309</span>
gaping fools standing here for, looking like a
passel of brainless idiots! &rsquo;Phone!&rdquo; he
screamed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Phone what? Who to?&rdquo; asked Jud with
exasperating calm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything! Everybody!&rdquo; was the
doubly illuminating reply. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll be killed!
Do you hear me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d have to be deaf as nails not to hear
you,&rdquo; said Jud as he spat a mouthful of tobacco
juice against the front wheel of the
wagon. &ldquo;All the &rsquo;phoning in creation won&rsquo;t
stop her. If she ain&rsquo;t of a mind to pull that
thing up to a halt from the inside, it ain&rsquo;t
likely that a fellow could do it by getting in
its path and yelling whoa, even if he&rsquo;d holler
as loud as you&rsquo;ve been doing at us. Why
didn&rsquo;t you try it when you see her coming?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they&rsquo;ve got to stop it! The constables&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;d you suppose I know? Get out of
my way and let me get at the &rsquo;phone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t going to do nothing of the
kind,&rdquo; replied Jud as he stepped in front of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_310' name='page_310'></a>310</span>
the belligerent Hank. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s some reason
for driving like that. I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s up,
but the first feller to interfere with her joy
ride is going to get hurt. I was in the cellar
of her dad&rsquo;s place doing an odd job of plumbing
for him when she come to me, and said:
&lsquo;Jud, I&rsquo;m going for a drive.&rsquo; I &rsquo;lowed that
was real nice, wondering why she&rsquo;d be telling
me that. &lsquo;I may have to drive pretty fast,
and I want you to telephone ahead as far as
you can to have the road clear. Tell the policemen
my name, and ask that they don&rsquo;t
stop me.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But her dad&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her dad ain&rsquo;t home. He went over
Riverhead way more than an hour ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Jud&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dry up that butting, Hank, or we&rsquo;ll lead
you out in the alley behind your store and feed
you tin cans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hank climbed back to his wagon-seat, and
Jud, noticing the determined expression in
the storekeeper&rsquo;s eyes, deputized two men to
keep watch of him while he went inside and
did some telephoning.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_311' name='page_311'></a>311</span></div>
<p>Elizabeth Fox reached the city limits without
being molested. She then looked at her
watch, and slowed down her car. She kept
the speedometer needle wavering within the
speed law till she set her brakes before the
building where the law firm of Starr and Jordan
maintained their offices. Harold was so
surprised to see his sister that he gave her the
name of the Trust Company for which she
asked before he realized what he was doing.
She glanced at the clock, hastily scribbled the
address on a card, and ran from the room.
Harold stood still in dumb amazement. He
walked to the window and looked down into
the street below. He recognized her red
motor-car as it glided through the traffic at
an alarming rate. A mild oath escaped him
as it dawned upon him that the name of the
bank was that of the firm through which the
interest payments had been made on the
Phillips loan. What on earth could she be
up to?</p>
<p>It was far past the noon hour when Elizabeth
returned. The office was empty, the
force having gone home for the Saturday
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_312' name='page_312'></a>312</span>
half-holiday. She turned from the locked
door, but it flew open, and Harold called to
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you&rsquo;d come back, Sis. In fact,
I meant to tell you that I wanted you to take
dinner with me, but you blew in and out so
suddenly that I didn&rsquo;t have time to collect
my thoughts. What are you up to, anyway?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, nothing much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you learn of this Phillips affair?
I take it that that was what all your hurry
was about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She only laughed in reply, her eyes dancing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know that you were on the inside
of this, and I don&rsquo;t know yet how much
you really know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know a lot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you find out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everybody has told me a little, and I
have been piecing it together for several days.
But can&rsquo;t we sit down, or go out to lunch?
I&rsquo;m really very tired, now that it&rsquo;s over, and
awfully hungry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you know that I had the name
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_313' name='page_313'></a>313</span>
and address of the firm which has been
paying Father the interest on the Phillips
loan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you told me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In my sleep?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, no. You were quite awake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sis, have you been eavesdropping?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Harold Fox! The very idea!&rdquo; she said
indignantly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like you one bit for
saying that. No, sir, I have not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I honestly didn&rsquo;t think it of you, but I
couldn&rsquo;t imagine any other way you could get
the notion in your head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You never told me a word till to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t know that I had that name in
my possession till you blew in here and asked
for it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not really and truly, I didn&rsquo;t. But I
took a chance. And you are such a poor actor
that I was certain you&rsquo;d tell me. Of course,
I knew that you went over to Australia to find
out about the man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The treats are certainly on me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make it a good big lunch, please,&rdquo; she
said smiling and starting for the door.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_314' name='page_314'></a>314</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Wait, Bets. What did you do over there
at the George Henry Trust Company?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must I tell, just now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not, but I&rsquo;d like to know if you
care to tell. It may save me from something
very unpleasant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean you will force me to tell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mercy me! No. I am better acquainted
with you than to try a thing like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you keep a secret, without giving
away one little word of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A client&rsquo;s counsel seldom repeats a confidential
business transaction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I paid the two years of interest just a few
minutes before that horrid old mortgage was
due, so Uncle Josiah would not have to lose
his place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gosh!&rdquo; was the inelegant reply.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a brick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His brow puckered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t that save him?&rdquo; she asked with
concern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure. But how did you know that Uncle
Josiah was a party to this mix-up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father told me that.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_315' name='page_315'></a>315</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;You should have been the lawyer of this
family. I never saw any one like you for
finding things out.&rdquo; Still apparently worried,
he added: &ldquo;But your check will give you
away. What if that happens to fall into
Dad&rsquo;s hands?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t use my check. I went to our
bank first, and drew out all my money. I
didn&rsquo;t have enough left to put back, so I&ndash;&ndash;well,
I didn&rsquo;t put it back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What under heaven did you do with
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I went down to an East River fish wharf,
and&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Took a corner on fish?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Harold, don&rsquo;t think me foolish. Uncle
Josiah had sold his boat, thinking to pay Father
off and save his place. I&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You bought back the old fellow&rsquo;s boat!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She nodded.</p>
<p>Harold did not laugh. Instead, he turned
toward his desk and busily fumbled papers.
When he spoke there was a note of tenderness
in his voice. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the best little sport in
seventeen States.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_316' name='page_316'></a>316</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that doesn&rsquo;t keep me from starving.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t come for anything else?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, except that I did want to talk with
you. We can do that while we eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather you would ask me any questions
before we go out. State secrets have
been known to leak out from restaurant
tables.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me where this Adoniah Phillips
lives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew! You don&rsquo;t pick the easy ones, do
you? You certainly go right after what you
want, Bets. But why do you ask?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I want to know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to think up a better reason
than that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he is one of your clients, why don&rsquo;t you
make him pay that interest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lawyers may advise, but they can&rsquo;t drive
unless they hold the reins of litigation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are just as exasperating as all lawyers,&rdquo;
she said with a show of impatience.
&ldquo;Do you know that your client has fallen heir
to a very large fortune? And do you know
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_317' name='page_317'></a>317</span>
that he could pay the principal as well as the
interest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good Lord, Sis! You&rsquo;re a wonder!
How on earth did you ferret all this mess
out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t matter. The thing that
matters is what Father and that Phillips person
are trying to do to Uncle Josiah. We
must stop them. If you know the truth about
the transaction between Father and Mr.
Phillips you have no right to allow this thing
to go on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harold&rsquo;s eyes narrowed. &ldquo;Trying to trap
me again, Bets?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I&rsquo;m not. I&rsquo;m just trying to get
you to look at things from Uncle Josiah&rsquo;s position.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many of the facts do you know
about this case?&rdquo; asked Harold in deep seriousness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know enough to form pretty good
conclusions of the injustice of the whole
thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think you know everything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No-o, not when you look at me like that,&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_318' name='page_318'></a>318</span>
she said, surprised by the earnestness of his
voice and manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has any one beside Father talked with
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She hesitated, then slowly shook her head.
&ldquo;You must not ask me that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you talked with Mr. McGowan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you,&rdquo; she answered, quickly
checking the look of surprise that leaped into
her eyes at the unexpected question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know just how far Mr. McGowan&rsquo;s
information may have led him into this matter,
but I have feared all along that he is not
half so ignorant as he appears. Come in here,
Bets,&rdquo; he requested, pushing open a door to
an inner office. &ldquo;I have some things I want
to show you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mercy, Bud! How mysterious you can
be!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An ounce of precaution is worth a pound
of lawsuits, and I don&rsquo;t want the slightest
possibility of a leak,&rdquo; he said as he locked the
door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My sakes! I had no idea you could be
so serious. Is this the way you act with all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_319' name='page_319'></a>319</span>
your clients? I&rsquo;d think you&rsquo;d frighten them
all away. You almost do me. It reminds me
of the way you would lock me up in the hall
closet to scare me when we were children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For once in my life I am serious, Sis.
We are no longer children, and this is far
from play. I wish to God it were nothing
more than that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Harold!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bets, you&rsquo;ve got a close tongue and loads
of good sense. I&rsquo;ve carried this thing just
about as long as I can without breaking under
it. I&rsquo;ve got to let off steam. You know
I&rsquo;ve tried to be on the square since my little
fling, and even then I was straight, but Dad
has never believed it. I&rsquo;m tempted now to go
wrong, and&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why on earth are you talking like this?
Has some one been accusing you of doing
wrong? Oh, Harold! You didn&rsquo;t fall into
trouble after all over in Australia, did you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, nor in love either,&rdquo; he replied, trying
to smile.</p>
<p>Elizabeth blushed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see that doesn&rsquo;t apply to all our family.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_320' name='page_320'></a>320</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re nice to say that.
And I don&rsquo;t care&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Bets, are you really in love with
him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have no right to jest about such
things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not jesting, honestly. I&rsquo;ve never
been so far from it in my whole life. I don&rsquo;t
blame you for liking that minister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, you were not making fun?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! I&rsquo;ve had all the fun-making knocked
out of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Harold,&rdquo; she said, coming nearer, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
made him hate me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hate you? There isn&rsquo;t a man living who
could do that. No one was ever blessed with
a more wonderful sister than I&rsquo;ve been.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elizabeth stared at her brother. Never had
she heard him make such a sentimental statement.
He had turned from her, and was
looking into the street below. With a sharp
swing he faced about.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, tell me all you know about Phillips
and the estate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess I really don&rsquo;t know very much
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_321' name='page_321'></a>321</span>
more than I&rsquo;ve told you. I know the man is a
half-brother of Uncle Josiah, and that he
mortgaged the old homestead to Father, and
that he married some trader&rsquo;s daughter in
Australia, and that the trader died, leaving a
large fortune. That&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Read those,&rdquo; said Harold, handing her
some papers which he had brought with him
from his own desk. &ldquo;And keep your nerve.
There are more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elizabeth read the papers through. One
was the original document of the trader&rsquo;s will;
the other was an Australian Government paper,
exonerating Mr. Adoniah Phillips. A
postscript to the will stated that Mr. Phillips
had left Australia for America.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew all that,&rdquo; said the girl as she returned
the papers. &ldquo;But they do help to
make matters clearer. I wasn&rsquo;t really certain
he had come over here. Have you found
him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. I&rsquo;ve never seen the man. What is
more, not one penny of that vast estate has
yet come into the possession of Adoniah Phillips.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_322' name='page_322'></a>322</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Harold! Do you mean to tell me
that you know where this man is, and that you
have not looked him up? You say he has not
received his inheritance? What are you trying
to tell me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know what I&rsquo;m saying. Neither he nor
his heir has received one cent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet you know where they are?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say I knew of their whereabouts.
But I will say that I know where to find the
heir, a son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should go to him at once, then, and
give him the opportunity to pay off that mortgage
on Uncle Josiah&rsquo;s home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I can do that. But it isn&rsquo;t so simple.
Right there is where I&rsquo;ve struck the
snag that has nearly driven me insane. How
to do it&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How? A lawyer saying a thing like
that? Just go to him and explain how it
all came about. If he is half a man he
will do what is right without any litigation.
That is so very simple that I wonder at
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Read that,&rdquo; he said, drawing from an inside
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_323' name='page_323'></a>323</span>
pocket another paper, and handing it to
her.</p>
<p>In the upper right-hand corner was an
Australian stamp.</p>
<p>At the end of the first line the letters began
to dance before her eyes, and to crowd into
one another. Elizabeth turned to her brother,
wild-eyed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Harold, this is false! Tell me it is false!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish to God it were, Bets. But you
must keep your feelings under better control
if you are to help me out of this miserable
state of affairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know it is false!&rdquo; she implored. &ldquo;I
shall tell everybody it&rsquo;s a lie! No one can
know him and believe that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must remember that this all happened
years ago, before you and I were born.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, his life now! Oh, Harold, you don&rsquo;t
believe this! Tell me it isn&rsquo;t true!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been almost sweating blood over it
since I discovered the truth. I&rsquo;ve tried to find
some other explanation or solution, but there
is none other. Father is guilty of the crime
for which Adoniah Phillips was made to suffer.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_324' name='page_324'></a>324</span>
I don&rsquo;t know how they got hold of his
true name, for he was going under an assumed
one over there. But they did, and the
worst of it is, the old trader&rsquo;s wife is here in
the city right now. She is on Father&rsquo;s track.
I&rsquo;ve been staving her off, but she smells a rat
in the fact that I bear his name, and I can&rsquo;t
hold her much longer from locating him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! No! You shall not tell me that Father
is a criminal! You must take back that
awful word about him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harold groaned, and settled back into his
chair. The girl fell back into hers, and covered
her face with trembling hands. She
sprang suddenly to her feet and to her brother&rsquo;s
side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father was never in Australia! He
made his money trading in Africa. We&rsquo;ve
heard him say that many times, and I believe
him. I shall not believe those papers. They
are blackmail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, I must go on alone. My temptation
was to cover this up, but, Bets, I can&rsquo;t. I
had hoped that you&rsquo;d go through it with me,
for it&rsquo;s going to be a mighty dirty mess to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_325' name='page_325'></a>325</span>
clean up. But if you persist in believing Father&rsquo;s
story instead of mine&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do believe you, too! But can&rsquo;t there be
some mistake?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If there had been the slightest chance I
should have discovered it before now, but
there isn&rsquo;t. It is God&rsquo;s truth. All these years
Father has been safe only because Adoniah
Phillips refused years ago to disclose his
identity. It&rsquo;s awful, Sis, but true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too awful to be true! It seems like
a horrible dream.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have no idea what agony it has cost
me. Do you think you can go through it
with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try, Harold. But, oh, it&rsquo;s hard!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think that Father might clear
the whole matter up if we should tell him
all we know? Maybe he could explain
things&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was the first thought that occurred
to me. But the longer I worked on the case,
and the more I discovered of the truth, the
more impossible I saw that to be. I&rsquo;m not so
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_326' name='page_326'></a>326</span>
sure that we&rsquo;d want him to save his skin, anyway.
He ought to face the music for his
wrong just the same as any other man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elizabeth did not once take her gaze from
her brother&rsquo;s face, while she spoke slowly and
distinctly: &ldquo;Father will not be afraid to face
the truth, even though it may mean financial
ruin. He is brave, and he is honest now. I
shall tell him all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be too hasty, Bets. I admire your
spunk. But answer me this: did it strike you
as strange the way Father acted that night
when I announced my contemplated trip to
Australia to look up Phillips?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She nodded ever so slightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And did it strike you as strange the way
he treated Mr. McGowan when he offered to
help him to his room?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why do you bring Mr. McGowan
into this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bets, if I had known one grain of the
truth that night I&rsquo;d have flatly refused the
appointment to this case at the risk of losing
my position in the firm. Father was afraid
that night. Here is one more paper I wish
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_327' name='page_327'></a>327</span>
you to read. I had it copied in Washington
last week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elizabeth unfolded the paper, and read:
&ldquo;Be it known that one Adoniah Phillips,
after due application, and upon his own request,
for reasons herein stated, is authorized
to change his name to&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The paper fell to the floor. The room began
to swim. The furniture violently rocked.
Elizabeth reached out and clutched her brother&rsquo;s
arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mack McGowan!&rdquo; she whispered faintly.
&ldquo;Oh, what am I saying? Why am I saying
that name? What has happened to me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor little girl! I thought my little sister
was stronger than that. I&rsquo;ve been a fool
for letting you read all those papers after the
strain you&rsquo;ve been through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mack McGowan!&rdquo; she repeated. She
seized the paper which her brother had lifted
from the floor. &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s in that paper, and
it&rsquo;s <i>his</i> name! Harold, what does it mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must brace up, Beth. The man you
are in love with is the son of Adoniah Phillips.
He bears his father&rsquo;s new name.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_328' name='page_328'></a>328</span></div>
<p>She was suddenly weary. She felt just one
desire: to get back home. She took Harold&rsquo;s
arm and led him toward the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to go home, and I need you to
drive the car.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
</div>
<p>During the homeward trip Elizabeth was
as one in a stupor. When they reached the
brow of the hill above the village, Harold
stopped the car. Elizabeth half turned about
in her seat, resting her elbow on the back
above and lifting her hand to her eyes to
shade them from the light. She gazed upon
the glory of the western sky where the sun
was dropping into a bed of gold, lavishly
splashing the low-hanging clouds with a radiance
that seemed to drip from their edges. A
shock suddenly brought her back to reality
with a pain at her heart. Silhouetted against
the gold of the sky-line, his head bared, his
shoulders thrown back, was a tall figure: the
son of Adoniah Phillips!</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good view for sore hearts, Bets,&rdquo;
commented her brother.</p>
<p>She caught her breath in quick gasps.
&ldquo;Yes. But, oh, Harold, it&rsquo;s so hard!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_330' name='page_330'></a>330</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; he agreed, taking her hand.
&ldquo;Have you thought out a line of action?
Where shall we begin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl did not answer. Harold followed
with his eyes the direction of her gaze. His
hand tightened in hers. The minister had
just recognized them, and was waving his cap
high over his head in welcome. Elizabeth
lifted her handkerchief and permitted the
light breeze to flutter it. Harold answered
with a swing of his arm. Mr. McGowan
started toward them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drive me home, Harold. I can&rsquo;t see him
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Sis, this may be our only time together.
Tell me what to do. I&rsquo;m lost. I
don&rsquo;t know which way to turn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must see Uncle Josiah first. He has
had time to think a lot, and he may know
how to help us. I&rsquo;m going to his place to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By George! You&rsquo;re right. I hadn&rsquo;t
thought of going to him. He does know
something about this. He was in my office
the other day, and asked a host of questions.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_331' name='page_331'></a>331</span>
He&rsquo;ll help us if he can. Why not stop there
now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not now. I&rsquo;m not decent to see any one,
or be seen. Please, take me home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He threw in the clutch and the car shot
down the hill, past a curious crowd in front
of the general store, and on up the knoll into
the Fox estate.</p>
<p>Mr. Fox had not yet returned from Riverhead.
He had telephoned that he might get
home for dinner. But the dinner hour came
and went, and still he did not return. After
the silent, and all but untasted, meal, Elizabeth
left the house by the rear entrance. She
hurried along the walk, out through the
wicket gate at the back, and down to the
beach. From here she turned into the path
that zigzagged across town-lots, over sand-dunes,
through brush heaps, to the rear of the
Captain&rsquo;s place.</p>
<p>She walked round the house to the side
door. She lifted the heavy knocker, and held
it tightly as though fearing to let it drop
against the rusty iron plate. What if Uncle
Josiah had forgotten his engagement, and was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_332' name='page_332'></a>332</span>
not home? But Uncle Josiah had never yet
forgotten a promise he had made her. She let
the piece of iron fall. The sound echoed
through the house. It frightened her, and she
poised as though of a mind to run. Instead
of the usual hearty boom for her to &ldquo;Come
in,&rdquo; the door swung wide, and she stood face
to face with the minister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she cried, stepping back into the
shadows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been expecting you, Miss Fox. Will
you come in?&rdquo; he cordially invited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were expecting me? But I&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hardly knowing what she did, and certainly
not realizing why she did it, she accepted
the invitation and entered. Her eyes
slowly widened as he closed the door. She
stood poised like a wild thing ready for flight
at the slightest warning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I trust that your father isn&rsquo;t ill again?&rdquo;
said the minister solicitously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No-o. That is, not yet. He&rsquo;s quite well,
thank you. He isn&rsquo;t home, or wasn&rsquo;t when I
left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_333' name='page_333'></a>333</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad your father isn&rsquo;t ill,&rdquo; he explained,
growing quite as embarrassed as she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Yes. Thank you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Fox, something must be wrong.
May I help you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Really, no. That is, not bad wrong,
yet,&rdquo; she stammered. &ldquo;Only he promised to
be home, and&ndash;&ndash;well, he isn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Captain will be back soon. He asked
me to entertain you till his return. I fear I&rsquo;m
not doing it very well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, you are. That is, I guess you
are. Is the Captain far away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He took Miss Pipkin over to Miss
Splinter&rsquo;s. Miss Splinter is very ill. Won&rsquo;t
you be seated?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, thank you. No, I think I&rsquo;ll stand.
Dear me! What can be the matter with me?
I&rsquo;m acting quite stupid and silly, am I not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She tried to laugh, but her dry throat gave
a cracked sound. Mr. McGowan noticed,
and did not complete the smile that was beginning
to form about his own lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really, I think I&rsquo;ll be going, and come
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_334' name='page_334'></a>334</span>
back again. I feel so very queerly, and&ndash;&ndash;uncomfortable
with&ndash;&ndash;with&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With me in the room?&rdquo; he finished with
a sad smile. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry. I&rsquo;ll step into my
study. If you need anything, please call.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had reached the door and the knob had
turned under his hand when she gave a cry,
between a sob and a plea. He swung quickly
about.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t leave me, please!&rdquo; she pleaded.
&ldquo;I mean, don&rsquo;t go on my account.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I seem to be disturbing you, and I
don&rsquo;t wish to do that,&rdquo; he said kindly.</p>
<p>She broke down completely. &ldquo;Oh, I do
need you so much! Please stay! I&rsquo;m afraid,
afraid of everything, afraid of myself! You
said one should keep a cool head, but I can&rsquo;t!
I can&rsquo;t! I&rsquo;ve tried so hard. Oh, Mack&ndash;&ndash;Mr.
McGowan, please help me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She finished her broken plea in muffled sobs
in the folds of his coat. He drew her against
him till his arms ached. She knew now that
she could make of her love for this man no
voluntary offering in order to save her father
humiliation. All afternoon and evening she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_335' name='page_335'></a>335</span>
had been forming that resolution. But this
love that had come to her, pure and undefiled
from the hand of God, could not be denied for
the sins of one man, even though that man be
her own father. She felt herself being swept
out into an engulfing current, nor did she wish
to stay its overwhelming power. For the first
time that afternoon she was conscious of real
strength.</p>
<p>Mr. McGowan tried to lift her face from
his shoulder, but she clung the closer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to look at you,&rdquo; he said jubilantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not just yet!&rdquo; she sobbed. &ldquo;I want to
get used to this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, let me hear you say you love me!&rdquo;
entreated the man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mack McGowan, I love you!&rdquo; She drew
back a pace. &ldquo;Now, you may look at me just
once, though I don&rsquo;t look like much with my
eyes all swelled up and red.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He drank in the beauty of the face before
him. &ldquo;Thank God! You do love me! It
isn&rsquo;t just pity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She nodded her head so vigorously that the
wisps of fair hair fell about her large blue
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_336' name='page_336'></a>336</span>
eyes. &ldquo;Yes, I love you, Mack. There, now,
you&rsquo;ve looked long enough. Kiss me, please.&rdquo;
She lifted her face.</p>
<p>Mr. McGowan was unstintingly obeying
the command when a loud knock jarred the
side door. They started and sprang apart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who can that be knocking like that?&rdquo;
asked the girl, hastily tucking away the stray
locks of hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be the Captain. But I wonder&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elizabeth laughed, and pointed toward a
window where the curtain was above the lower
sash. The Captain had seen them!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care if he did see. Let me go to
the door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had taken one step in that direction
when the door flew back and in came Mr.
James Fox.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father! You!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without replying, Mr. Fox glared ferociously
at the minister. His hand trembled
on the head of his walking-stick. The blood
surged into his face. Elizabeth, growing
alarmed, started toward her father. But the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_337' name='page_337'></a>337</span>
Elder waved her back. Mr. McGowan broke
the awful silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t help it, Mr. Fox. I&rsquo;m very
sorry that this has come against your will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it is true. God help me!&rdquo; The
Elder&rsquo;s words came with surprising calm, but
his tone was harsh and hard. &ldquo;So it is as I
was warned. It is hard to believe that my
little Beth has proven untrue to me.&rdquo; He was
breathing hard. Pointing his stick in the direction
of the minister, he finished with savage
calm, &ldquo;My little girl here alone, and with a
man like you! God help me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be careful!&rdquo; ordered Mr. McGowan.
His words were sharp, as with blazing eyes
he met the glare of the Elder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father, you must not talk and look like
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alone with him!&rdquo; repeated Mr. Fox.
&ldquo;I saw the whole shameless proceeding
through that window, and it is needless for
you to deny what has happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are not trying to deny it, Father.
I&rsquo;m proud of it. We tried so hard not to love
each other, too, when we found out how set
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_338' name='page_338'></a>338</span>
you were against it. But we couldn&rsquo;t help it.
We did try, didn&rsquo;t we, Mack?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You tried!&rdquo; sneered her father. &ldquo;I suppose
this man forced you to steal from your
home under cover of night, and come to him,
over paths that were dark and out of the way,
against your will. Do you expect me to believe
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elizabeth came between the men as the
minister took a step toward the Elder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done nothing to be ashamed of. I
came here of my own accord, and you have
no right to spy on me through those who are
willing to do such vulgar things because you
pay them. I came here to see Uncle Josiah.
He wasn&rsquo;t in, and Mr. McGowan was&ndash;&ndash;well,
he was entertaining me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will do! You shall not add perjury
to your sin. You knew perfectly well that
Pott was not home. You knew he was in the
city. Your stories don&rsquo;t hang together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father, you must not talk to me like that.
Uncle Josiah came home this morning, and
I made arrangements to meet him here to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_339' name='page_339'></a>339</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;And he was conveniently out, I suppose,
so you might meet this fellow here
alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you refuse to listen to reason, you may
think what you like. I love that man you&rsquo;ve
been maligning!&rdquo; she cried, her eyes filling
with angry tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You love him? Are you brazen enough
to stand there and say that to my face?&rdquo; he
shouted, losing his self-control. &ldquo;Him!
You! I&rsquo;ve a mind&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;Why, you silly little
sentimental fool. You go so far as to
flaunt&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Fox, allow me to explain,&rdquo; interrupted
the minister.</p>
<p>The Elder did not heed the note of warning
in the steady voice, but clutching his walking-stick
with nervous fingers he started toward
his daughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stand back!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Fox stood back, almost falling against
the wall. The minister&rsquo;s voice was as hard as
his own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems that the time has come for a
reckoning,&rdquo; said Mr. McGowan. &ldquo;You have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_340' name='page_340'></a>340</span>
stood in my way long enough. Elizabeth,
will you kindly step into my study?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I prefer to remain here, Mack. You may
need me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I say may be quite unpleasant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I may need to add to what you say. I&rsquo;ll
stay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well. Mr. Fox, our strained relations
must come to an end. If you can show
any just cause why I&rsquo;m at fault, I shall do all
in my power to rectify it. I do not know the
slightest reason for your attitude against me,
but&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You lie, sir!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The minister&rsquo;s lips tightened. &ldquo;Only your
age protects you in the use of that word to me.
I repeat what I have said,&ndash;&ndash;and it will be as
well for you not to question my integrity
again,&ndash;&ndash;I do not know why you have treated
me as you have. I now demand an explanation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you will favor us with a little of your
family history first,&rdquo; said the Elder with a
sneering laugh, &ldquo;there will be no need of any
further explanation on my part.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_341' name='page_341'></a>341</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;You seem to think me a vagabond, or
something quite as bad if not worse. Well,
I&rsquo;m not. My family history is nothing to
brag about, but the record is clean. If you&rsquo;ll
be seated I&rsquo;ll be glad to furnish you with such
bits as may be of interest to you. It isn&rsquo;t
so difficult to hold one&rsquo;s temper while sitting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elizabeth lifted an imploring face to the
minister. &ldquo;Please, dear, don&rsquo;t say anything
more! For my sake, don&rsquo;t. Wait till you
both have had time to think over how foolish
this all is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Foolish, you think! He need not speak, so
far as I&rsquo;m concerned,&rdquo; declared Mr. Fox, refusing
the proffered chair. &ldquo;I know his
whole miserable story. I knew his parents. I
take back my request. You doubtless would
not tell the truth. What I wish my daughter
to know, I shall tell her in the privacy of our
own home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elizabeth looked as if she could not trust
her own ears for what she had just heard
from her father&rsquo;s lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Fox, Elizabeth shall know my story
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_342' name='page_342'></a>342</span>
now, and from my own lips. I have absolutely
nothing to hide or be ashamed of. My
father and mother were honest people. If it
be a crime to be poor, then, they were guilty
beyond redemption. They came to this country
from Australia when I was little more than
an infant. My father took ill and died shortly
after our arrival. Mother said his death was
the result of confining work he had done in
Australia. I can remember my mother quite
well, but she died before I was five. I was
taken into a neighboring family, almost as
poor as mine had been. As I grew up I
worked hard, and saved every penny. My
mother had left me one heritage that was
priceless, a craving for knowledge. The people
who brought me up sacrificed to help me
along till I reached high school. I worked
my way up through four hard years, into college,
and then on into the seminary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is about all there is to my uninteresting
history. I came here as a candidate
for this church. For the first time in my
whole life I was beginning to taste real happiness.
But no sooner had I taken my first
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_343' name='page_343'></a>343</span>
breath of independence than I saw I must
fight to hold the ground I had gained. I
gloried in the opportunity. I was glad that
I could do for your town what no other minister
had been able to do. I took special delight
in getting hold of those lads and men at
the Inn. Hicks and his crowd didn&rsquo;t trouble
me one bit, or even alter one plan I had for
the members of the club. I didn&rsquo;t even grow
discouraged when the opposition came from
you, for I kept hoping that you&rsquo;d see your
mistake and come over to my aid. But time
went on, and you did not. I sought reasons
for your injustice. I concluded at last that
you had discovered my love for your daughter,
and that you did not consider my family
connections to be sufficiently strong to permit
any such union. I did all in my power to argue
myself out of that love. But I soon discovered
that a man cannot argue a cyclone out
of his heart any more than he can argue one
out of God&rsquo;s sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If there is no other reason for your actions,
sir, than my love for Elizabeth your
opposition may as well be withdrawn right
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_344' name='page_344'></a>344</span>
here and now. Otherwise, I shall marry
Elizabeth against your will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems to me, young man, that you are
quite sure of yourself about something you
can&rsquo;t do. I admire your nerve,&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;the Elder
was pulling out each word with violent tugs
at the side-whiskers,&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;but we&rsquo;ll see, sir, who
holds the trumps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean that you offer me no other alternative
than to fight this through to a finish?&rdquo;
asked the minister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I offer you no alternative whatsoever. I
command you to remain away from my
daughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I refuse to obey any such order
unless you give some just and adequate
reason.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall give you reason enough. Why
did you stop with that little bit of family history
where you did?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had nothing to add of any importance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do not think it of importance to tell
us what that confining work was your father
did in Australia?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t the slightest idea. If Mother
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_345' name='page_345'></a>345</span>
ever told me I was so very young that I have
forgotten.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps your mother wished to spare you.
If so, I do not intend to tell you at this late
hour in your life. But what he did is sufficient
reason for my forbidding you to carry
your attentions any further.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father, this is getting really ridiculous,&rdquo;
declared his daughter. &ldquo;We love each other,
and that fact is greater than all else. Not
one word which you may say against Mack&rsquo;s
people will make the slightest difference with
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear child, if I dared tell you one-tenth
of the truth,&ndash;&ndash;but I dare not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall not talk like this any longer.
It&rsquo;s silly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since when has my child taken to giving
her father orders? You are forcing me to
speak. I&rsquo;d rather cut off my right arm than
do it, but I must save my little girl from&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall not listen to another word!&rdquo; broke
in the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be still! I shall speak, and you shall listen.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_346' name='page_346'></a>346</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Father! You dare not. I love him,
and&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll blush at the thought of having
used that word in connection with that man
before I have finished.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter what you say, you can
never change&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beth, I must ask you to stop interrupting
me. This man&rsquo;s father is an out&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better not say that, Father!&rdquo; cried
Elizabeth. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll wish you hadn&rsquo;t when it
is too late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Elder&rsquo;s face grew livid. His hands
trembled violently as he steadied himself to
deliver his final blow. Elizabeth drew close
to Mr. McGowan as though to shield him, and
shot a defiant glance at her father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall tell the truth, and you shall hear
it. That man&rsquo;s father is an outlaw. He is a
fugitive from justice. All this prattle about
him being dead is a hoax.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Elder now stood back to watch the result
of his bomb. But what he saw was far
more mystifying than satisfying. It was Mr.
McGowan who drew back as the girl threw
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_347' name='page_347'></a>347</span>
her arms about his neck. Elizabeth entreated
him not to believe one word which her father
had just uttered. Mr. Fox stood dumbfounded.
Mr. McGowan did nothing but
stare blankly across the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come here at once!&rdquo; ordered the Elder.
&ldquo;Beth, do you hear me? Come away from
that man. Don&rsquo;t you see he recognizes the
truth? Are you entirely mad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For answer Elizabeth slipped her hands
further over her lover&rsquo;s shoulders and locked
her fingers behind. Mr. McGowan did not
seem to realize the utter surrender with which
she did this. He saw only the figure across
the room and heard a faint whisper from out
the past. It came from out his childhood,
shortly after his father&rsquo;s death. It had made
no definite impression on his young mind, but
like a haunting shadow had stuck to him all
these years. In a husky voice he demanded
that the Elder explain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is nothing more to explain, sir.
You know to what I refer as well as I. If
you are any kind of a man you will stop right
where you are, and release my daughter from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_348' name='page_348'></a>348</span>
her foolish promise. Beth, if you love this
man as you say you do you will come from
him at once, for I&rsquo;ll ruin him if you persist in
your sentimental infatuation. If you show a
willingness to comply with my wishes, I shall
let the matter drop, providing he leaves our
town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. McGowan tried to push the girl from
him, but she only tightened her grip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You dare not carry out your threat!&rdquo; she
shot at her father. Then without warning
she released the minister, and turned about.
The fire of indignation and anger leaped from
those eyes that had only given her father love
and kindness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall not threaten longer, I shall act. I
shall apply for deportation papers for this man
as an undesirable citizen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is not that, Father!&rdquo; cried the girl,
making her last appeal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall have him deported if&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She gave a dry hysterical laugh. &ldquo;Try it,
if you dare! I know his story. I know yours,
too. Don&rsquo;t you touch me!&rdquo; she cried, as her
father started toward her. She fled again to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_349' name='page_349'></a>349</span>
the minister. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let him touch me,
Mack!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Fox stopped abruptly. He dropped
the papers which he had taken from his
pocket. &ldquo;Beth,&ndash;&ndash;my dear,&ndash;&ndash;have you lost
all your senses? What were you saying?&rdquo;
he barely gasped.</p>
<p>The outer door opened, and Captain Pott
entered his house.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
</div>
<p>Captain Pott paused on the threshold.
He looked from one to the other of the occupants
of the room. He crossed over and
picked up the paper which the Elder had
dropped. He slowly read the contents.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t breaking in on an experience meeting,
be I?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Uncle Josiah! Tell Father it isn&rsquo;t
true!&rdquo; entreated the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d say &rsquo;twas purty likely, according to
all the signs.&rdquo; He chuckled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t laugh. I can&rsquo;t stand it.
Tell Father about&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There now, Beth, you and the parson set
sail for a little cruise down the beach. I&rsquo;ve
something private to say to your dad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What you have to say to me, sir, will be
said in the presence of my daughter,&rdquo; replied
the Elder, making a pathetic attempt at stiffness.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_351' name='page_351'></a>351</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re mistook on that p&rsquo;int, Jim. I&rsquo;m
skipper aboard here, and them&rsquo;s orders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Elder&rsquo;s hands shook uncontrollably as
he gripped the head of his walking-stick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re all wasting good time,&rdquo; observed
the seaman. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d best heave to, and obey
orders. Mutiny won&rsquo;t be allowed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I intend to remain right here till this mystery
concerning me is cleared up,&rdquo; declared
the minister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mystery about you?&rdquo; exclaimed the Captain.
&ldquo;Why, Mack, there ain&rsquo;t nothing like
that about you. You&rsquo;re as clear as an open
sky. What I&rsquo;ve got to say is just &rsquo;twixt Jim
and me. You couldn&rsquo;t get in on it to save
your soul. Now, you and Beth clear out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Josiah Pott, I recognize no right that permits
you to intrude into my family affairs. If
what you have to say is concerning the mortgage
you had better speak at once. There is
nothing about that which is confidential.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s according to the way you look at
it. I&rsquo;d a heap sight rather say it in private,
Jim. It may prove embarrassing&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, <a name='TC_10'></a><ins class="tnchg" title="&#34;spelling standardized&#34;">good night</ins>. Come, Beth.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_352' name='page_352'></a>352</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t no use of you going off mad,
Jim. I only wanted a word with you about
something that does consarn us both a mite.
You ain&rsquo;t got no objection to that, have
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The show of apparent humility on the part
of the Captain made it possible for the Elder
to remain, providing the conference should be
made brief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t no more anxious to get it over
than I be. We&rsquo;ll step right in here in Mack&rsquo;s
cabin, if you don&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Elder balked. &ldquo;I prefer witnesses,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;Otherwise, you may come to my
home to-morrow evening. I did not seek this
unpleasant interview, and since I leave it to
my lawyers to carry on my business affairs, I
do not intend to hound my debtors personally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t been hounding me personally,
Jim, but there&rsquo;s some things that you can&rsquo;t
leave even to crooked lawyers. You&rsquo;d best
handle this personally. If that shyster tries
to get in on this his neck won&rsquo;t be wuth the
skin that covers it.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_353' name='page_353'></a>353</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;You still persist in trying to threaten me,
I see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Jim, this ain&rsquo;t a threat. If you want
the witness part after I get through I&rsquo;ll accommodate
you with plenty of &rsquo;em. But I
cal&rsquo;late we&rsquo;d best talk it over private-like fust.
I happened onto a feller the other day by the
name of John Peters, and he spun me the
likeliest yarn I ever heard about Australia.
I thought you&rsquo;d like to hear it, but I don&rsquo;t
want to take your valuable time. Good
night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on, Josiah! I did not catch that
name. Who was it you saw?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the Captain did not hold on to anything
except to his news concerning John
Peters. He entered the minister&rsquo;s study and
closed the door.</p>
<p>A little later the side door opened and closed
quietly. The seaman thought the Fox had
run for his hole. But the study door soon
opened. The Captain turned his back, drew
out his pipe, and with slow deliberation began
to pack the bowl with shavings from a black
plug of tobacco.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_354' name='page_354'></a>354</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I think I can spare you a few minutes,
Josiah,&rdquo; barely whispered the Elder. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t want to seem arrogant and high-handed
in the matter of that small loan. And if there
is anything&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, Jim, about that loan.
Come right in, and set down. Thought you&rsquo;d
gone hum.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was the preacher going out with my
daughter. He shall see the day when he&rsquo;ll
pay for his impudence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most of us get caught afore we&rsquo;re through
life, Jim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why I&rsquo;m doing this little
service for you to-night, except it be for the
sake of our boyhood friendship. I am willing
to suffer this inconvenience&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s mighty kind of you,&rdquo; cut in the Captain
sharply. &ldquo;But for once that boyhood
rot ain&rsquo;t going to help you none. It ain&rsquo;t
going to let you turn any more of them tricks
of a black rascal simply because you pose as a
shining martyr. The way you&rsquo;ve treated
Mack McGowan&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If this conversation is to be about the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_355' name='page_355'></a>355</span>
minister, I shall save you the trouble of speaking
by going at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t no trouble for me to speak. What
I&rsquo;ve got to say does consarn Mack a heap, and
you&rsquo;d best listen. When I finish you&rsquo;ll see
that it&rsquo;s best for him to stay right here in this
church, if he wants to, after all the mean low-down
tricks you&rsquo;ve served him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall not allow you to pick a quarrel.
I regret that you are so much inclined that
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can keep all your regretting till
later, you&rsquo;ll likely need it. What I want to
make plain to you is that Mack is going to
stay right here in Little River, perviding he
wants to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed? You surprise me. I usually
get my way about church matters. Permit
me to say that you shall not interfere in these
affairs any more than in those of my own
home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s been the trouble with you all these
years, Jim. You&rsquo;ve been getting your own
way too long. I&rsquo;m not going to interfere one
mite, I&rsquo;m just going to dictate for this once.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_356' name='page_356'></a>356</span>
If I ain&rsquo;t way off in my soundings, you&rsquo;ll be
mighty glad to have him as a son-in-law, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Fox rose and lifted his cane. He
tapped the corner of the desk. He opened
his mouth, but his anger choked him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You make me nervous, Jim. Set down
and set still. I ain&rsquo;t going to speak of the
parson right off. Ain&rsquo;t you going to set
down? There, that&rsquo;s better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Elder&rsquo;s face was livid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cal&rsquo;late I&rsquo;ll talk better if I get this thing
going,&rdquo; observed the seaman, lighting his pipe.
&ldquo;Now, Jim, I ain&rsquo;t sartin why I&rsquo;m going to
talk to you in private like this, but&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By God! It&rsquo;s time you&rsquo;re finding out!
Your impudence has got beyond all bounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t swear like that. It ain&rsquo;t becoming
to one of your position in the church.
Them black scowls and blue cuss-words ain&rsquo;t
going to get you nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You impudent dog! I thought you were
intending to pay me that little debt, or I
should never have entered this room. Your
insults are&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sartin sure. &rsquo;Most forgot that.&rdquo; The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_357' name='page_357'></a>357</span>
Captain drew out a bank-draft and handed it
over to the surprised Elder. &ldquo;Thanks for
reminding me. It&rsquo;s best to clear all decks
afore man&oelig;uvers are begun in earnest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall be going now. But I cannot take
that draft. You will learn more about that
later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suit yourself on both p&rsquo;ints, Jim,&rdquo; replied
the seaman studying the tips of his heavy
boots. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d best take this money, though.
It pays off all I owe you. Anyway, I&rsquo;d stay
if I was you. You&rsquo;d sure enjoy Peters&rsquo;
yarn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two men eyed each other like a pair of
wild animals. The Elder at length rose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pott, I&rsquo;ll not listen to more of your insane
talk. I fear all your trouble has gone to your
head. I&rsquo;m sorry if that is the case. You
would do well to consult some brain specialist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it ain&rsquo;t my head it&rsquo;s gone to. It&rsquo;s my
heart.&rdquo; His words were gentle, but his eyes
were as hard as flint. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been itching to
get hold of you for some time, Jim, but I ain&rsquo;t
seen any handle till now. Since you made me
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_358' name='page_358'></a>358</span>
that offer up to your house t&rsquo;other night I&rsquo;ve
been wanting to choke you. Yes, to choke
you till your lying old pipe of a gullet would
shut off your wind for good and all. But the
law won&rsquo;t allow me that pleasure.&rdquo; He continued
with intense bitterness: &ldquo;I s&rsquo;pose
you&rsquo;re wondering where I got that money to
pay off your filthy loan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So this is the gratitude you offer for my
kindness?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a fat lot you&rsquo;ve ever done for me!
You&rsquo;ve just told me this ain&rsquo;t no good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fact of the matter is, my lawyers
probably foreclosed on the real mortgage at
noon to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, that lawyer feller I see wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t far
off his course, after all,&rdquo; replied the Captain,
laying the draft on the table. &ldquo;Now, Jim,
show your hand and be damn quick afore I
call your turn on the deal,&rdquo; demanded the seaman
as though certain that a prior conclusion
had proven correct.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have nothing to show at this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the Almighty, then, look out! I sold
my <i>Jennie P.</i> to get you that money. It was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_359' name='page_359'></a>359</span>
purty hard to see her go, but it wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t all loss,
not by a heap. John Peters bought her. I
told him why I was selling her. He was real
sorry, and then he spun me the yarn about
your crookedness in Australia. I got the
rest of the story by installments, about the
way you treated Adoniah. John give me
some mighty interesting news about an old
Mrs. Rogers, who was the mother of Adoniah&rsquo;s
wife. She&rsquo;s here right now looking for
heirs and crooks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Elder had risen again, but the name
spoken by the Captain struck him like a shot.
He dropped back, his head fell forward, and
his hands locked over the head of his stick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After that I seen Harold, and he told me
where the woman was staying. I looked her
up, and she told me the whole enduring yarn.
It was Clemmie&rsquo;s last letter from Adoniah
that set me going on your trail, and the old
woman cleared up the fog. I had that letter
in my pocket up to your place that night, but
Providence or something kept me from showing
it to you. That old lady had a picture of
her darter Emmie, and it nearly knocked me
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_360' name='page_360'></a>360</span>
over when she showed it to me. It was the
same that Mack has here in this frame of his
own mother. Take a look at that picture.&rdquo;
He opened a drawer, lifted out a gilt-frame,
and passed a small daguerreotype across to
the Elder. &ldquo;Mack has showed me this often,
and I see that he was a chip off the old block
on his mother&rsquo;s side. But I never dreamed
the truth, because of his name.&rdquo; The Captain&rsquo;s
eyes narrowed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been wondering,
Jim, if that wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t what went to your head
that night he had dinner up there,&ndash;&ndash;seeing the
likeness, all of a sudden, to his mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused to give the Elder time to study
the picture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Josiah, what on earth has all this nonsense
to do with me? Just what are you accusing
me of?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing yet. I&rsquo;m coming to that part.
I looked up that feller who was with you over
there, and I dragged your damned sin out of
him. When it comes right down to it, I hate
like time to take away your chart and compass
this way, but you&rsquo;ve been doing it to others
for so long that I cal&rsquo;late it&rsquo;s coming to you.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_361' name='page_361'></a>361</span>
I&rsquo;d have let the old lady tear out your side-whiskers
if it hadn&rsquo;t been for them children of
yours. It was for them that I asked you in
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Elder roused and made a pathetic effort
to straighten his drooping figure. &ldquo;I
think,&ndash;&ndash;er,&ndash;&ndash;Josiah, I see your game at last.
You purpose to frighten me with these wild
tales from some old witch. I shall compel
you to offer proof, for all your insinuations,
in court.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Insinuations! Proof! Lord, Jim!&rdquo; cried
the Captain, aiming a powerful finger in
the direction of the Elder. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got proof
enough to lock you up in the London Towers,
or wherever it was you let Adoniah suffer for
your infernal wickedness. Proof! Hell! You
ain&rsquo;t that big a fool. Set still and hear me.
You never see the shores of Africa. It was
in Australia that you and Adoniah got in with
that trader Rogers,&ndash;&ndash;Emmie&rsquo;s father,&ndash;&ndash;and
you was getting rich trading in opals. Then,
the both of you fell in love with Emmie, and
Adoniah beat you out and married her. It
wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t long after that when Adoniah took
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_362' name='page_362'></a>362</span>
down with a fever. God, man! When I
think what you done to him when he couldn&rsquo;t
fight back, I could kill you! You got trapped
in a bad deal, and while Adoniah was raving
with a fever you took all the money there was
and skipped. You was careful to ship all the
blame for your dirty work on Adoniah afore
you sneaked out a rich man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pott, that is enough. There is not a
court in all this country that would believe
your wild tale. Try it, and see how quickly
they would lock you up in a madhouse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They won&rsquo;t believe what I say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dare you to go into any court and try it.
I&rsquo;m too well known.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jim, don&rsquo;t toss me that old line, it&rsquo;s a mite
too green and slimy to look tasty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m through with this stuff and nonsense,
sir!&rdquo; shouted the Elder. He started for the
door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I ain&rsquo;t through with you. I&rsquo;m
only just begun.&rdquo; The Captain intercepted
him. &ldquo;You set there, or I&rsquo;ll set you. This
trader, Rogers, got onto your little game
afore you set sail, and tried to get you arrested.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_363' name='page_363'></a>363</span>
But you&rsquo;d covered your dirty tracks.
He caught you, though, and made you sign
something&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would not stand in court. I can
prove that I was forced to sign a false statement
at the point of a gun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, Jim. I&rsquo;m glad I ain&rsquo;t got to
prove to you that you done the signing.&rdquo;
Carefully choosing his words, the Captain
continued. &ldquo;That feller you had hiding with
you that night done some signing, too. I got
hold both them papers. I found that other
feller and made him dance the devil&rsquo;s tune.
He done some purty things for a missionary
of the Son of God. His name was Means.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know the rest of the yarn, how Adoniah
was taken off on one of them floating
hells, called a convict-ship. The thing was
nearly wrecked, and he was making his escape
after swimming to land when he turned into a
mission place for a bite to eat. He come face
to face with that fat missionary who got you
out of the country. Instead of feeding him,
and giving him decent clothing, like a Christian
ought to do, he took him to the officers.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_364' name='page_364'></a>364</span>
They put him in a dungeon. For nigh onto
two years he was kept there. Then this
Rogers feller got hold of a lawyer with as
much heart as brains, and they got him out.
The old lady said he wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t much to look at
when he come out. They sent &rsquo;em over here,
thinking it would be good for Adoniah&rsquo;s
health. But he was all wore out, and couldn&rsquo;t
hold a job. He was a heap too proud to beg
or ask help. Not wanting to disgrace his
family name with the damned record you give
him, he changed his. The old lady said it was
about then that they lost track of &rsquo;em. I got
the rest of the story from Harold on my way
home to-night from Edna&rsquo;s place. That&rsquo;s
why I was late.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Adoniah and his family lived in them dirty
streets of lower East Side. He was a wreck,
and Emmie tried to work to keep things up.
Both of &rsquo;em died, starved to death, while you
and that damn missionary was getting fat on
the money you stole. You had busted up the
firm so Rogers couldn&rsquo;t help none then, even
if he&rsquo;d found &rsquo;em. The little boy they left
was found by some neighbors. He was &rsquo;most
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_365' name='page_365'></a>365</span>
starved and nearly froze. He was living with
an old janitor woman, and she was sending
him out on the streets to sell papers! Think
of that, Jim Fox! A little boy, five years old,
peddling papers to pay your bills with! Them
folks found him one morning in a doorway,
asleep!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old seaman&rsquo;s voice choked. He slowly
refilled his pipe. When he resumed his narrative,
his breath was coming heavily. &ldquo;This
Rogers feller lost all track of &rsquo;em. He made
money fast after he got on his feet, but all his
searching got him nothing. The old lady
said they kept paying some interest or other
on a debt Adoniah owed to you in order to
save some property of his. I didn&rsquo;t tumble
just then what &rsquo;twas she meant. But I found
out to-night. When the old man died, Mrs.
Rogers shut down on that paying business
and began in real earnest to look for her darter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Elder had slouched forward in his
chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You thought you was hid, and so you
come back to this town to stick your head in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_366' name='page_366'></a>366</span>
one of its sand-heaps. I tell you, Jim, I ain&rsquo;t
been very strong on the p&rsquo;int of a Providence
directing our ways. It&rsquo;s always seemed to
me like a blind force pushing us from behind.
But I&rsquo;m getting converted. When that there
missionary showed up at the installing meeting,
the devil come right forward and asked
for his pay. Means wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t long in seeing the
mother&rsquo;s face in Mack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was Mack who sold them papers. It
was that low-down missionary of a Means
who was working in a mission down on the
East Side after coming back who put him in
with that janitor woman. You both done all
the dirt you could to his dad by stealing all he
had, and now because you&rsquo;ve been scared that
he&rsquo;d squeal on you, the both of you are trying
to steal his right to live as a man. I suppose
if you&rsquo;d have known that he was as ignorant
as a babe about all this, you&rsquo;d done nothing
against him. But Providence come in by
way of your own home. Harold got that
woman over here afore he knew where the
scent was going, but he can&rsquo;t stop her now.
Beth found it all out to-day, too.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_367' name='page_367'></a>367</span></div>
<p>The expected blast of hot denial and bitter
denunciation did not follow. Instead, the
Elder merely bent his head and acknowledged
it all. He did not bewail his misfortune. He
seemed beyond that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a mighty bad thing, Jim, when a feller
lets the furniture of his house get more
important than himself, ain&rsquo;t it? It leaves
him kind of bare when it&rsquo;s all moved out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Josiah, you&rsquo;re right. It&rsquo;s even worse
when the furniture has been stolen,&rdquo; remarked
the man. He raised his head and looked at
the little gilt-framed picture on the desk. He
covered his face. With a dry sob he folded
his arms across the picture, and dropped his
head upon them. &ldquo;My God! I didn&rsquo;t mean
to do it when I began. I must have been insane.
It seemed so easy at the time. I&rsquo;ve
suffered a thousand hells all these years!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know. You just went along the way
that seemed easy-like. At fust it ain&rsquo;t hard
to go with the greedy crowd, but the turning&rsquo;s
mighty hard. You sartin went the easiest
way for yourself, Jim, but them you done
wrong to, died in awful poverty.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_368' name='page_368'></a>368</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t stand any more!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;John told me that Adoniah was going to
get your hide after he got back here, but when
he see you was married and had a little
baby&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop it, Josiah! Do with me as you like,
but don&rsquo;t tell me any more. I&rsquo;ll go insane!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cal&rsquo;late what you said about suffering
your share is as nigh the truth as you&rsquo;ve come
in many a year. If I&rsquo;d been intending to
give you up to that old woman, do you cal&rsquo;late
I&rsquo;d brought you in here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Josiah, do you mean that you do not intend
to give me up?&rdquo; asked the crumpled man
incredulously. He raised his head and peered
across the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not if you&rsquo;re willing to obey orders.
Others have been suffering, and that&rsquo;s got to
stop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do anything you say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fust thing, that Sim Hicks and his
gang has got to be choked off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you refer to, but&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jim, I thought we&rsquo;d cut out that old
green line of pretending. I ain&rsquo;t going to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_369' name='page_369'></a>369</span>
nibble, so just stop casting it at me. I mean
his booze-selling to them boys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That can be arranged,&rdquo; hurriedly agreed
the Elder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thought it likely could. The second little
matter is that Mr. McGowan is going to
stay right here in this church as minister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do my best&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;Yes, I shall see to
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, about that money you stole from his
dad. That goes back to Mack with interest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Josiah, I can&rsquo;t do that. It would
ruin me. I wouldn&rsquo;t mind for myself, but
my family&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, that&rsquo;s the hard part of paying off
old debts, the innocent has got to suffer. But
that can be fixed so it won&rsquo;t bother you much.
It might do you good to take a taste of your
own medicine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can this be done without the village finding
it out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s purty hard to give up your position
as village hero, ain&rsquo;t it, Jim? I cal&rsquo;late it&rsquo;s
going to be purty tolerable hard to dress a
hypocrite up like a saint without people finding
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_370' name='page_370'></a>370</span>
it out sooner or later, but we&rsquo;ll try it for a
spell. Harold said to-night that he&rsquo;d draw
up papers for you. We&rsquo;re going to try to
keep this a sort of family skeleton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can I ever thank you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d best give them thanks to the Almighty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do, most heartily.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just touch a match to this paper you
dropped. Here &rsquo;tis. I cal&rsquo;late you wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t
intending for no one to see this but Beth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is true, Josiah. I wished to keep
her from going any further with Mr. McGowan.&rdquo;
With trembling fingers he set fire
to that piece of paper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One word more about money. What are
you going to do about the loan on this place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may keep that, Josiah, as a token of
my appreciation for what you have done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not this one,&rdquo; said the Captain. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
honest enough to pass. I mean that one the
interest has been paid on all these years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid that my lawyers foreclosed on
that at noon&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From what Harold said, I cal&rsquo;late you&rsquo;ll
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_371' name='page_371'></a>371</span>
find the interest was paid afore they had a
chance to foreclose. If I was you, Jim, I&rsquo;d
just cancel that mortgage. The interest has
more than paid it back these years. Mack&rsquo;s
estate otter be clear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man before whom great ones had been
made to tremble because of financial power,
now meekly nodded assent to a sea captain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we&rsquo;ll just include everything you owe
Mack in the papers Harold is going to draw
up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be only too glad to do as you say.
But how about this Rogers woman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see to her. She&rsquo;d never recognize
you as the dude who beat her son-in-law.
You&rsquo;ve changed consider&rsquo;ble since then.
You&rsquo;ve even changed a mite to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Captain took up his pipe from the
table, shook off the ash, and relighted it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that all, Josiah?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. I cal&rsquo;late you&rsquo;d best be going.&rdquo;
He handed the Elder his hat, and lifted his
walking-stick from the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, Josiah. You have been very
kind to me. More than I deserve.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_372' name='page_372'></a>372</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t no room for argument on that
p&rsquo;int.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the Elder reached the door the Captain
halted him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I was you, Jim, I&rsquo;d keep my oar out of
that love affair of Mack and Beth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite right, Josiah. Good night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Elder got out of the house and into the
road in a stumbling fashion. He climbed the
knoll to his estate, a saddened and broken old
man, but with a relief of mind and heart that
he had not known for years.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now, ain&rsquo;t you a pair to look at, and you
to give your sermon this morning, Mr. McGowan!
You look a heap sight worse than
Edna Splinter, and she&rsquo;s been raving with a
fever all night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Pipkin made this observation while
the three of them sat at breakfast Sunday
morning.</p>
<p>The minister absent-mindedly asked concerning
the condition of Miss Splinter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She &rsquo;peared to be a trifle easier this morning.
But what&rsquo;s ailing the both of you?
Look as if you&rsquo;d been setting up all night like
two owls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cal&rsquo;late we&rsquo;re on our uppers, Clemmie.
But we&rsquo;ll be fit as fiddles when we get some
of them cakes stowed amidships, and ballast
&rsquo;em down with a few swallers of that coffee.
There ain&rsquo;t everybody that can b&rsquo;ile coffee like
you, Clemmie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be foolish, Josiah.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_374' name='page_374'></a>374</span></div>
<p>After a very light breakfast, Mr. McGowan
excused himself from the table, saying
he must do some work on his sermon before
the church hour. As the door to the study
closed the Captain pushed back his plate and
chair. He slid the latter round the end of the
table, and placed it by Miss Pipkin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the lan&rsquo; sakes, Josiah! You ain&rsquo;t going
to make love to me this morning, be you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t sartin, Clemmie. It depends on
your partic&rsquo;lar frame of mind,&rdquo; he replied
slowly, a quiet kindness in his old eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know as I feel like being made
love-sick,&rdquo; she said, but without the old spirit
of stubbornness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Clemmie,&rdquo; he said resignedly.
&ldquo;I cal&rsquo;late you know best. I&rsquo;m going to spin
you a yarn about what took place round these
premises last night. That is, if you&rsquo;re willing
to listen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, of course I&rsquo;m willing to listen.
Did that lawyer show up here again with his
old mortgage?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you bet he didn&rsquo;t. And what&rsquo;s more,
he won&rsquo;t come prowling round again, either.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_375' name='page_375'></a>375</span></div>
<p>The Captain told his housekeeper the whole
story. He passed as lightly as he could over
the part where Adoniah had married the
trader&rsquo;s daughter. Miss Pipkin gave no sign
that she cared in the least, or that the news
had shocked her. But when the Captain rehearsed
the treachery of Mr. James Fox, she
grew rigid. She dabbed her apron into the
corners of her eyes as he unfolded the story of
the suffering of the little family. The old
man paused to wipe the tears from his own
eyes as he recounted the finding of the lad in
the doorway with a pile of morning papers in
his lap. For some time after he had finished
neither spoke. The Captain dangled his bandanna
at the end of his nose, and Miss Pipkin
dabbed her checked apron against her wet
cheeks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Josiah,&rdquo; she whispered eagerly, &ldquo;have
you found the boy yet? Is he still alive?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; A prolonged blow followed.</p>
<p>She laid her hand in his. &ldquo;Where is he?
Do you think I could see him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s in there.&rdquo; He pointed toward the
study door.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_376' name='page_376'></a>376</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;In that study with Mr. McGowan? Is
that what you said?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You brought him here from the city yesterday?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The seaman shook his head. &ldquo;He come
long afore that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;ve you been keeping him? Ain&rsquo;t
you going to fetch him out?&rdquo; she cried, rising.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go get him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait, Clemmie. It&rsquo;s been nigh onto
twenty-five year since he was born, so he ain&rsquo;t
a baby. Let Mack fetch him. Mack!&rdquo; called
the Captain sharply. A slight twinkle in his
eyes offset the assumed severity of his command.</p>
<p>The door opened and Mr. McGowan stood
on the threshold. Miss Pipkin stared from
the one to the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be the both of you clean crazy?&rdquo; she demanded,
as the men grinned rather foolishly
at each other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Clemmie. We&rsquo;ve just woke up to
our senses, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you think this a good joke,&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_377' name='page_377'></a>377</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t no joke,&rdquo; said the Captain, motioning
Mr. McGowan to come nearer. &ldquo;I
give you my word, it ain&rsquo;t, Clemmie. There&rsquo;s
Adoniah Phillips&rsquo; son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a smothered exclamation Miss Pipkin
dropped back against the table. &ldquo;You&ndash;&ndash;you&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;
But she ended with a gasp for
breath and words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Cap&rsquo;n is telling you the truth,&rdquo; confirmed
the minister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&ndash;&ndash;and you let me tell you all that
nonsense about him and me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re doing me an injustice, Miss Pipkin.
I did not know one thing about all this
till last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Pott had risen. In his eagerness
he stretched out his arms to the confused
housekeeper. She turned from staring at the
minister, and like a bewildered animal fled
blindly in the direction of the kitchen. She
found herself, instead, in the seaman&rsquo;s arms.
Here she stuck, and with hysterical sobs clung
to the old man. Mr. McGowan came nearer.
At sight of him she fled to his arms. For the
next few minutes the practical, every-day
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_378' name='page_378'></a>378</span>
Miss Pipkin did things of which no one had
ever imagined her capable. The Captain&rsquo;s
voice roused her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, young feller, you go loving where
you&rsquo;re wanted. I&rsquo;ve been waiting for this too
many years to be cheated out by a young rascal
like you.&rdquo; He seized the not unwilling
Miss Pipkin, and pushed the minister in the
direction of the kitchen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clemmie, ain&rsquo;t this grand?&rdquo; asked the old
man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s really been you all these years, Josiah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Been me? You mean you&rsquo;ve loved me
all the time, Clemmie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Um-hm,&rdquo; she nodded vigorously. &ldquo;But
I was that stubborn that I wouldn&rsquo;t give in.
I always looked forward to your proposing.
You ain&rsquo;t proposed to me for a long time, Josiah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Clemmie, are you sartin sure it&rsquo;ll be
all right now? If you get your rest, are you
sartin you won&rsquo;t feel different? Don&rsquo;t you
think you&rsquo;d otter wait?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Josiah, ask me right now, so I can&rsquo;t back
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_379' name='page_379'></a>379</span>
out, or get on another stubborn streak. I
thought it all out &rsquo;longside Edna&rsquo;s bed last
night. She was raving, and calling for some
one, poor thing, who she&rsquo;d refused to marry
when she was young. I said then and there
that I wasn&rsquo;t going to my grave with that
kind of thing hanging over me. That is, if
you ever asked me again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You say you made up your mind last
night, Clemmie? You sure it wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t what I
told you about Adoniah being married?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That had nothing to do with my decision.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, you mean we&rsquo;re going to get married?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t asked me yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Clemmie Pipkin,&rdquo; he began, bending
his knees in the direction of the floor, and
upsetting the table as he went down with a
thud, &ldquo;will you ship aboard this here old craft
as fust mate with a rough old skipper like
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lan&rsquo; sakes! Get up off that floor. You
look awful silly. Get up this minute, or I&rsquo;ll
say no.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_380' name='page_380'></a>380</span></div>
<p>The Captain got up with more alacrity
than he had gone down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you marry me, honest, Clemmie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. You see, I kind of wanted to hear
myself say it, because I&rsquo;d made up my mind
that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An exclamation from the kitchen interrupted
what the seaman was doing. The
minister had retired thither to clear the mist
from his eyes which had gathered there at
signs of spring-time in the fall of these dear
old lives. He now stood in the door, holding
a dripping coffee-pot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my coffee!&rdquo; cried the housekeeper.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s boiled all over the place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drat the coffee. Let her b&rsquo;ile!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Boil it certainly had, over the stove, on to
the floor, and had collected in a puddle at the
threshold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what comes of not attending to
your cooking,&rdquo; observed the practical Miss
Pipkin. The other Miss Pipkin, who had
been sleeping for years in the living sepulcher
of her heart, was saying and doing many
things quite different.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_381' name='page_381'></a>381</span></div>
<p>From the cross-roads came the sound of the
church-bell, calling the people of Little River
Parish to worship.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the bell!&rdquo; exclaimed Miss Pipkin.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only a half-hour before service.
If you&rsquo;ll excuse me, Mack, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll
go this morning. You don&rsquo;t mind if I call
you Mack here at home, do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want you to call me that, Aunt Clemmie.&rdquo;
He gave her a hurried kiss, and
started toward his room. At the corner of
the upset table he paused. &ldquo;If I didn&rsquo;t
have to preach this morning I&rsquo;d stay home,
too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean you&rsquo;d go walking down &rsquo;long
the beach,&rdquo; corrected the Captain.</p>
<p>Miss Pipkin looked oddly at her lover.
&ldquo;Be they engaged?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They was, but I guess they ain&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jim came nigh sp&rsquo;iling things last night.
Mack said they&rsquo;d call it all off till he found
out more about his people. He was &rsquo;feared
from what Jim had said to him that he had no
right to love Beth. I cal&rsquo;late he see that it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_382' name='page_382'></a>382</span>
was right enough to go ahead afore I got
through with him this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Josiah, he&rsquo;ll marry us, won&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You just bet he will!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t it funny he never said nothing about
being glad we was engaged?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We ain&rsquo;t told him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he saw.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Script&rsquo;re says something about having
eyes and seeing not, and having ears and
hearing not. Mack&rsquo;s as nigh to obeying
the sayings of Script&rsquo;re as any one I
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so, Josiah. He is so good without
trying to be,&rdquo; declared Miss Pipkin. She
lifted a hand to each of the old man&rsquo;s shoulders,
and he put his arms about her. &ldquo;Do
you believe in the care of Providence, Josiah,
and in the guiding hand of God?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Captain tightened his embrace, and
one of the bony hands of the housekeeper
slipped into the knotty fingers about her
waist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m larning to, Clemmie, but I&rsquo;m going
to need a heap of help. I ain&rsquo;t used to these
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_383' name='page_383'></a>383</span>
religious channels, and I cal&rsquo;late you&rsquo;ll have to
take the helm right often.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had not heard the sound of footsteps
in the outer room. It was Mrs. Beaver&rsquo;s voice
that caused them to start.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought I&rsquo;d come over to borrow
some&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Beaver stopped short on the threshold,
looked at the Captain and the housekeeper,
and began to retreat. The practical Miss
Pipkin was the first to recover speech.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on right in, Mrs. Beaver. That&rsquo;s a
silly thing for me to say, seeing you&rsquo;re already
in. But what is it you&rsquo;d like to borrow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Beaver continued to retreat and stare.
She saw the puddle of coffee on the floor.
She eyed with interest the upset table. She
saw that the Captain was undetermined what
he ought to do with his hands. She watched
him as he stumbled backward into the cupboard.
Her face was a study.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was it you was going to ask for,
Eadie?&rdquo; asked the seaman, trying to appear
unconcerned in his decided embarrassment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I never!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Beaver.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_384' name='page_384'></a>384</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re engaged,&rdquo; announced Miss Pipkin
in matter-of-fact tones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Engaged! You and&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, she and me,&rdquo; finished the Captain
eagerly.</p>
<p>Mrs. Beaver&rsquo;s hands dropped helplessly to
her sides.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there anything more you&rsquo;d like to
know?&rdquo; asked Miss Pipkin kindly, as she
crossed the room and put an arm about the
spare figure of her neighbor. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re that
happy that I wanted you to know, and I&rsquo;m
real glad you come over when you did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything else I want to know?&rdquo; she
asked. &ldquo;I should say there is. What has
happened to Harry? He come home last
night all different, talking for the minister till
I couldn&rsquo;t get a word in edgewise. It was
awful late, too. And he told me that Sim
Hicks had left town, or was going this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cal&rsquo;late some one&rsquo;s clothed Harry in his
right mind. You know, Eadie, that&rsquo;s Script&rsquo;re.
Sim has took a trip for his health.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Harry tells me that Mr. Fox is for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_385' name='page_385'></a>385</span>
the minister, too. Something must have happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, something has happened. Eadie,
you rec&rsquo;lect that time when you fust spoke to
me about the minister staying in my house you
said I&rsquo;d be in the way of the Lord if I&rsquo;d do it.
I wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t very pleasant to you for going
ahead and doing it while I was away, but you
sartin did what Providence wanted that
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Beaver did not attempt to reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was it you wanted to borrow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked from the one to the other, and
made this comment: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m mighty glad for
the both of you. You&rsquo;re good, and you both
deserve what you&rsquo;ve got.&rdquo; She kissed Miss
Pipkin on the cheek, and turned toward the
door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eadie, what was it you come for?&rdquo; asked
the housekeeper in a strange voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I come over for a pinch of salt, but&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give her the hull sack, dear,&rdquo; ordered the
Captain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess&ndash;&ndash;I think&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;I really don&rsquo;t
need the salt,&rdquo; stammered Mrs. Beaver.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_386' name='page_386'></a>386</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Here, Eadie, don&rsquo;t go off mad. I didn&rsquo;t
mean anything by what I said. I&rsquo;d give
half what I own this morning to a hobo if he&rsquo;d
ask for a crust of bread.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, Josiah. But I guess I got what
I really come for. God bless you both!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that she was gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, ain&rsquo;t that the strangest you ever
see?&rdquo; observed the Captain.</p>
<p>He was cut short by the sound of a familiar
toot out in the harbor. He stared at the
housekeeper in dumb amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clemmie, did you hear that? What in
tarnation was it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sounded like your power-boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it ain&rsquo;t round here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Together they went outside. Together
they stood on the stoop and watched a boat
nose its way to the old mooring of the
<i>Jennie P.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s her!&rdquo; whispered the seaman hoarsely.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my <i>Jennie P.</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did not move from his place beside Miss
Pipkin, but held tightly to her hand as John
Peters came up from the wharf.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_387' name='page_387'></a>387</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a paper for you, Josiah. A girl
come into my place about noon yesterday and
made me sign it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Pott was too surprised to even
reach out for the piece of paper offered him.</p>
<p>Miss Pipkin took it, and unfolded it carefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Read it for me, Clemmie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It only says that the <i>Jennie P.</i> was
bought back by Josiah Pott.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I never&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That girl said she&rsquo;d come to represent
you, and paid cash.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without a word the three went down to the
wharf, and John Peters rowed the dory, with
two passengers aboard, out to the <i>Jennie P.</i></p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>It was late in the afternoon when Mr. McGowan
left the house. Fall permeated the
air with an invigorating twang. Here and
there the landscape showed the touch of frost.
The marsh grass was turning brown. Among
the trees and shrubbery color ran riot. The
Fox knoll was a blend of beauty. As the
minister passed the estate he sought for a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_388' name='page_388'></a>388</span>
glimpse of the Elder&rsquo;s daughter among the
trees, or in the garden. But she was not to
be seen.</p>
<p>For a long way he kept his course up the
beach. He was thinking. How could he explain
to Elizabeth the meaning of his actions
last night? Would she listen after he had refused
to give heed to her explanation?</p>
<p>Suddenly, he became aware that he stood
on the spot where he had turned his ankle the
night she had come to him from the water&rsquo;s
edge, and his thoughts were choked in the furrows
of his brain. He seemed to hear her
voice again as she had spoken that night of
the impossibility of his love. He looked
about. Far up the peninsula he recognized
her. She was coming to him as straight as
the line of the beach permitted. He started
in her direction. She waved him back. He
waited. On she came. Neither attempted
to speak till she had reached his side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been waiting for you,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I
thought you would never come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You still want to see me after the way I
treated you last night?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_389' name='page_389'></a>389</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Please, don&rsquo;t speak of that. I knew
Uncle Josiah would tell you everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did tell me all. I want you to forgive
me for not taking your word that there
was nothing in my past which would prevent
our love, or mar it. I didn&rsquo;t realize that you
knew what you were saying. I feared that I
had no right to love you after your father had
spoken as he did of my parentage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With intense anticipation he held out his
hands, but she drew away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not now. I did not understand what
Father&rsquo;s obligation to you would involve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elizabeth, dear, do you mean you won&rsquo;t
forgive me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have nothing to forgive in you, Mack.&rdquo;
In her eyes was a return of the warmth of love
she felt, but her attitude was one of firm resolve.
&ldquo;I have come to you to-day because
I want to tell you that just for the present we
must be only good friends. I&rsquo;ve been thinking
all night long about you, and now that
you know who you are, and what my father
has done against your father&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that is all past!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_390' name='page_390'></a>390</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Not for me. Father ruined your father,
and has grown rich on your money. Not till
every cent of that is paid back can I think of
marrying you.&rdquo; There was the weight of
dead finality in every word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Elizabeth&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please, Mack, don&rsquo;t make it harder for
me than you must. This is not easy, but you
will see where it is best, when you have taken
time to think it over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have not talked this over with your
father, or with Harold?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Father was ill last night, and Harold
was so tired that he has been sleeping all
day. It would make no difference what either
of them might say. I am doing this because
it is right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do not know of the arrangements
that are to be made?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All I know is that Father owes you the
money, and that it is yours and must be paid
back to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elizabeth, there are papers to be drawn
up, and&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mack, please don&rsquo;t! I&rsquo;m tired, and can&rsquo;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_391' name='page_391'></a>391</span>
stand much. Don&rsquo;t try to change my decision.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But those papers which Harold is to draw
up must alter that decision. That is the only
ground on which I shall accept the terms.
Your father is to be given all the time he needs
to pay me back. At first I flatly refused. I
didn&rsquo;t want to take any of his money. But
Uncle Josiah made me see that it was the only
thing to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, it is the only thing to do.
You are going to let Harold draft those papers
because Father must give up what does
not belong to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not permit one stroke of the pen unless&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Mack, you must! This is your duty
to make Father&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elizabeth, dear, it is not your father&rsquo;s
money I want. All that means nothing to
me. I am consenting to the arrangement
simply because I believe it will be best for him
to pay it back. It&rsquo;s you I want!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned from him to look out over Long
Island Sound. The sun was completing its
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_392' name='page_392'></a>392</span>
daily journey by tossing up glorious hues of
gold, splashing the western sky without stint
from its unseen pot of blending colors. Her
face seemed to catch and hold the glory of the
sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beth, we must not sacrifice the love which
God has given us. That is something which
all the money in the world cannot buy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned about to face him. Her eyes
were filled with the reflection of the fire that
glowed on the inner shrine of her heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right, Mack. Our love is God&rsquo;s
gift.&rdquo;</p>
